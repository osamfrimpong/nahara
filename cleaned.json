  "ABORTION": {
    "Introduction": "Abortion refers to the expulsion of the foetus and other products of conception before the 28th week of pregnancy. It may occur spontaneously (threatened, inevitable, incomplete, complete or missed) or be induced (therapeutic, criminal). Both spontaneous and induced abortion may become complicated by infection (sepsis) and/or profuse bleeding. After appropriate treatment and discharge from the hospital, it is recommended that patients report back to the hospital if there is lower abdominal pain, fever, vaginal bleeding, and malodorous discharge. A follow-up review should also be done in two weeks.",

  "Severe or complicated malaria": {
    "Introduction": "Severe or 'complicated malaria' can arise from delay in diagnosis or inappropriate treatment of uncomplicated malaria. It mostly occurs in children under 5 years of age, pregnant women and non-immune individuals. The events causing most deaths in severe malaria are related to cerebral involvement (cerebral malaria), severe anaemia, hypoglycaemia, severe dehydration, renal failure and respiratory acidosis. The diagnosis of severe malaria is based on clinical features and confirmed with laboratory testing. Not all cases of severe malaria have high parasitaemia and initial blood film examination may be negative. Where the diagnosis is suspected, treatment must be started without delay while awaiting confirmation.",

  "Neonates, Pre-Pubertal, and Pubertal Children at Risk of STIs": {
    "Introduction": "Neonates, pre-pubertal, and pubertal children are also at risk of contracting STIs. The modes of transmission in these children are mostly through maternal infections, sexual abuse or exploitation, and voluntary sexual activity in older children. The STIs in this age group include neonatal conjunctivitis (ophthalmia neonatorum) and other STI-related syndromes similar to that in adults. Some of these STIs (e.g., gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia), if acquired after the neonatal period, are indicative of sexual contact. For other STIs (e.g. HPV infections and vaginitis), the association with sexual contact is not clear."

  "Poisoning ": {
    "Introduction": "Poisoning represents the harmful effects of toxic amounts of any substance on the body. In many cases, only mild symptoms and signs will develop. However, suspected poisoning should always be considered a medical emergency since the situation may rapidly evolve to become critical. Many deaths due to poisoning can be prevented with early initiation of good supportive care and general treatment measures. Symptoms and signs of poisoning depend on the specific exposure, and may be local, systemic, or both. Effects may occur immediately, or several hours or days later. The severity depends on many factors, including the type of substance, the route of exposure (ingestion, inhalation, injection, dermal application, etc.), the dose and duration of exposure, and patient or environmental factors. Obtaining the original container or a sample of the substance is often most helpful, along with a thorough history and physical examination and laboratory analysis to look for characteristic features of poisoning with specific agents. Judicious use of antidotes for poisoning with specific substances may be added to general treatment measures based on these findings. A Poison Control Centre exists in Ghana to support health professionals in developing rational and timely strategies for diagnosis and treatment of poisoning.",

Without treatment, multiple lesions appear all over the body. The disease is rarely fatal, however it can lead to chronic disfigurement and disability in about 10% of affected individuals if left untreated. Treatment with antibiotics is curative and relapse is rare. Overcrowding, poor personal hygiene and poor sanitation facilitate the spread of the disease.",
