Affected skin is reddened and uncomfortable. Intertrigo is particularly common in those who are overweight and patients with diabetes mellitus.Body folds (flexures) are prone to inflammatory rashes because of relatively high skin temperature and moisture from insensible water loss. Sweating that is not easy to evaporate and friction from movement of adjacent skin, results in the sore skin.

ABORTION Abortion refers to the expulsion of the foetus and other products of conception before the 28th week of pregnancy. It may occur spontaneously (threatened, inevitable, incomplete, complete or missed) or be induced (therapeutic, criminal). Both spontaneous and induced abortion may become complicated by infection (sepsis) and/or profuse bleeding.After appropriate treatment and discharge from hospital, it is recommended that patients report back to hospital if there is lower abdominal pain, fever, vaginal bleeding and malodorous discharge. A follow up review should also be done in two weeks.

ACNE IN VULGARISAcne vulgaris (pimples or spots) is a common chronic inflammatory skin disorder involving the hair follicle and sebaceous gland which presents mainly in adolescence. A variety of spots appear mostly on the face and other parts of the body. Severe  acne may  require evaluation to exclude an underlying hormonal disorder. This condition may induce some psychological disturbances. The choice of treatment depends on age, severity, and whether the acne is predominantly inflammatory or comedonal.CAUSESIncreased sebum secretionAbnormal keratinisation of the hair follicles (hereditary)Increased sensitivity of the sebaceous glands to male hormonesPropionibacterium acnesProlonged use of systemic and topical steroids e.g. Anabolic steroids such as danazol, stanozolol and nandroloneUse of pomades, especially products that contain lanolin, petrolatum, vegetable oils, butyl stearate, lauryl alcohol and oleic acidContraceptive agents: medroxyprogesterone injection, implanted or intrauterine progesterone, and oral contraceptivesPregnancyPolycystic ovarian syndromeAdrenal disorders SYMPTOMSPimples (on the face and occasionally on the trunk, chest and shoulders)Greasy skinFacial disfigurementSIGNSComedones (blackheads and whiteheads)PapulesCystsScarsNodulesPustulesHirsutism (suggest excess androgens) INVESTIGATIONSUsually noneSerum testosterone (in females with accompanying hirsutism and virilising features)Pelvic ultrasound (in females to exclude polycystic ovaries if hirsutism present)TREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo improve cosmetic appearanceTo prevent complications particularly scarringTo reassure patientTo identify and avoid any causative or contributing factors Non-pharmacological treatmentCounselling of patientsPharmacological treatmentA.

ACUTE CYSTITISAcute cystitis is an acute inflammation of the bladder. Women are affected 10 times more than men due to the shortness of their urethra compared to that of men. 40%-50% of all women will develop cystitis in their lifetime. The ascending faecal-perineal-urethral route is the primary mode of infection. 0ccasionally sexually transmitted organisms are involved. Risk factors include urethral catheterization and diabetes.CAUSESE. coli (about 80%)Staphylococcus saprophyticusKlebsiellaProteus mirabilisGonococcusEnterococci SYMPTOMSLow grade feverFrequencyNocturiaUrgencyDysuriaHaematuriaCloudy and foul smelling urineLow back and suprapubic pain SIGNSLow grade feverSuprapubic tendernessHaematuria INVESTIGATIONSUrinalysisMid-stream urine for culture and sensitivityFBCFBSImaging of urinary tract in recurrent or persistent cases to exclude anatomical abnormalities, lower urinary tract obstruction etc.Urethrocystoscopy in selected cases TREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo eradicate infectionTo prevent recurrence and complicationsTo relieve pain Non-pharmacological treatmentLiberal oral fluids to encourage good urinary outputPre-coital and post-coital emptying of the bladderPersonal hygiene and proper cleaning after defaecation especially in females Pharmacological treatmentAcute uncomplicated cystitis (absence of fever and flank pain)1st Line Treatment Evidence Rating: [A]Nitrofurantoin, oral,Adults100 mg 6 hourly for 5-7 daysChildren12-18 years; 50 mg 6 hourly for 7 days3 months-12 years; 750 micrograms/kg 6 hourly for 7 days2nd Line Treatment Evidence Rating: [A]Ciprofloxacin, oral,Adults500 mg 12 hourly for 5-7 daysChildren12-18 years; 250-750 mg 12 hourly1 month-12 years; 7.5 mg /kg 12 hourly (dose doubled in severe cases)Neonates7.5 mg/kg 12 hourlyOrCefuroxime, oral,Adults500 mg 12 hourly for 5-7daysChildren12-18 years; 250 mg 12 hourly (dose reduced to 125 mg 12 hourly in lower urinary tract infections)2-12 years; 15 mg/kg 12 hourly (max. 250 mg 12 hourly)3 months-2 years; 10 mg/kg 12 hourly (max. 125 mg 12 hour- ly)AndEvidence Rating: [C]Mist Potassium citrate, oral, 10 ml 8 hourly if urine is acidic (pH of 6 or below).

ACUTE EPIDIDYMO-ORCHITISThis is an acute inflammation of the epididymis and testis usually due to a bacterial infection. It may follow ascending infection from the urethra (including STIs), instrumentation/catheterization, untreated lower urinary tract obstruction and Genito-urinary surgery. It is a known complication of mumps. Poorly managed acute epididymo-orchitis may be complicated by septicaemia, abscess formation, chronic epididymo-orchitis, secondary hydrocele, infertility and Fournier's gangrene.Before managing as acute epidymoorchitis make sure testicular torsion has been conclusively excluded.

This is an acute and life-threatening infection in which the epiglottis and surrounding tissue become acutely inflamed and oedematous causing severe obstruction of the upper airways. The disease tends to run an extremely rapid course (4-6 hours) to respiratory failure and death.It is more common in children. However, the incidence  has reduced significantly due to the current immunisation schedule with the pentavalent vaccine.Examination of the throat in patients with this condition must be done only in the presence of a doctor capable and ready to intubate.CAUSESHaemophilus influenzae type BStreptococcus pyogenesStreptococcus pneumoniaeStaphylococcus aureusSYMPTOMSSudden onset of high feverDrooling of salivaDysphagiaBreathing difficultySIGNSExtremely ill and toxic childFeverHead is held forward to extend the neckBreathing difficultyWeak voice (not hoarse)Reduced air entry on auscultationStridorCyanosis in very sick childrenSwollen and reddened epiglottisINVESTIGATIONSFBCBlood cultureLateral soft tissue X-ray of the neckTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo relieve obstructionTo treat bacteraemiaNon-pharmacological treatmentEstablishment of airway if necessary by intubation or tracheostomyPharmacological treatmentFor treatment of bacterial infection1st Line Treatment Evidence Rating: [B]Cefuroxime, IV,ADULTS750 mg-1.5 g 8 hourly for 7 daysCHILDREN25 mg/kg 8 hourly for 7 daysAndMetronidazole, IV,ADULTS500 mg 8 hourly for 7 daysCHILDREN7.5 mg/kg 6 hourly for 7 days2nd Line Treatment Evidence Rating: [B]Cefotaxime, IV,ADULTS1-2 g IV or IM 8 hourly for 7 daysCHILDREN50 mg/kg 8 hourly for 7 daysOrAmoxicillin + Clavulanic Acid, IV, ADULTS1.2 g 12 hourly,Increased to 1.2 g 8 hourly for 7 days in severe infectionsCHILDREN12-18 years;  600 mg to 1.2 g 12 hourly, Increased to 1.2g 8 hourly for 7 days in severe infections 3 months-12 years; 30 mg/kg 12 hourly,Increased to 30 mg/kg 8 hourly for 7 days in severe infections7 days-3 months;  30 mg/kg 8 hourly for 7 daysPreterm and < 7 days; 30 mg/kg 12 hourly for 7 daysNote 20-2Treatment should be changed to oral antibiotics when appropriate and continued for a total of 7 daysREFERRAL CRITERIARefer all patients immediately to a specialist if there is no expertise available for intubation or tracheostomy.

ACUTE KIDNEY INJURYAcute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a term that has now replaced the term Acute Renal Failure(ARF). It describes a sudden decrease in renal function occurring over a period of hours to days resulting in accumulation of nitrogenous waste products and disruption of blood volume, electrolyte and acid-base balance.The differential diagnosis of AKI includes prerenal azotaemia, renal (intrinsic) and post renal (obstructive nephropathy) forms of AKI. The most important risk factor for the development of AKI is the presence of pre-existing chronic kidney disease. 0ther than good medical care with avoidance  of volume  contraction,  prevention of  hypotension and avoidance of nephrotoxic agents, no specific interventions have been reliably demonstrated to prevent the development of AKI. During management, a strict fluid input and output chart should be maintained.

ACUTE LOWER ABDOMINAL PAINAcute lower abdominal pain in a woman may have several causes. These include Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID), ruptured ectopic pregnancy and septic abortion. The latter two are surgical emergencies, which require extreme urgency in their management (See sections on 'Ectopic Pregnancy' and 'Abortions').PID is caused by organisms which may be Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI)-related or other bacteria that ascend from the lower genital tract and produce inflammation of the uterus, fallopian tubes and other structures in the pelvis. However, after excluding ectopic pregnancy, STI-related organisms are the most likely cause of lower abdominal pain in a sexually active woman who has not recently delivered a baby, or has no past or recent history of uterine instrumentation. The presence of intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUCD) favours the development of PID particularly in the month following insertion.

Acute orthopaedic infections, which often present as emergencies, include acute osteomyelitis, acute septic arthritis, acute pyomyositis, acute-on-chronic osteomyelitis, and acute-on-chronic septic arthritis.Acute osteomyelitis and septic arthritis can co-exist in the same individual. They are more common in children and in patients with sickle- cell disease. When the diagnosis is made in an adult, it is important to exclude immune-suppression. Staph. aureus and epidermidis account for the majority of the above infections. The commonest route of infection is haematogenous and may originate from skin lesions and ENT infections.It is important to cover empirically with appropriate antibiotics without necessarily waiting for the culture and sensitivity report.CAUSESStaph. aureusStaph. epidermidisSalmonella (common in sickle-cell disease)Haemophilus inf/uenzaStrept. pyogenesStrept. faecalisE. coliOpen fracturesIatrogenicImplant surgeryJoint aspirationsFemoral vessel proceduresIntra-osseous infusions and transfusionsUmbilical vessel catheterizationSYMPTOMSFeverPainInability to move affected limbSwellingLethargyRefusal to feed (children)SIGNSFebrileSwellingInability to use the limbINVESTIGATIONSFBC, ESRSicklingCRPBlood cultureX-ray of affected partUltrasound scan of affected part (may also be used for guided aspiration)Gram stain and culture of aspirateMRI (if available)Radionuclide scans TREATMENTTreatment objectivesEradicate infectionPrevent development of chronicityPrevent complicationsNon-pharmacological treatmentSplintingUltrasound guided aspirationIncision and drainagePharmacological treatmentA.

Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage. Many factors influence the feeling and emotion of pain and these factors vary from person to person. Pain is what the patient says it is.Acute pain (as opposed to chronic pain) is defined as lasting for less than three months and is due to noxious stimuli from identifiable causes such as trauma, surgery, or acute illness.Management of acute pain must be individualized to each patient and should include analgesia as well as treatment of the underlying condition. Special attention must be given, and precautions taken in providing pain relief in children, the elderly, pregnant women, as well as those with concurrent hepatic or renal disease, and those who are opiate tolerant or have a history of substance abuse.CAUSESTraumatic musculoskeletal injurySurgeryBurnsLabour and deliveryHeadacheSickle-cell crisisMyocardial infarctionAcute abdomen e.g. acute pancreatitisJoint inflammationOthersSYMPTOMSDepend on the underlying causeSIGNSDepend on the underlying causeINVESTIGATIONSDepend on the underlying causeTREATMENTTreatment objectivesResuscitate the patient if necessaryRelieve painTreat any underlying disorderNon-pharmacological treatmentPlace affected part in most comfortable position where appropriateElevation of affected part where indicatedSplinting when indicatedCold or warm compresses where indicatedReassurancePharmacological treatmentParacetamolNon-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDS)OpioidsNerve blocks with local anaestheticsMultimodal treatmentA.

Acute rheumatic fever is an illness caused by an immunological reaction to group A streptococcal infection of the throat. The onset of symptoms occurs 1-3 weeks after an untreated or inadequately treated throat infection. The disease occurs mainly in children and adolescents with a peak age of 5-15 years. Acute rheumatic fever often results in lasting damage to heart valves leading to the chronic form, which is known as rheumatic heart disease.Individuals who have had acute rheumatic fever previously are more likely to have subsequent episodes. These recurrences may cause further heart valve damage. Following treatment of an acute episode, secondary prophylaxis should be continued for a minimum of 10 years after the recent episode of acute rheumatic fever or until age 21 years (whichever is longer). For those with severe rheumatic heart disease secondary prophylaxis should be continued indefinitely.Rheumatic heart disease is an important cause of heart failure and premature death. In Ghana, acute rheumatic fever may mimic malaria, typhoid fever and other febrile conditions, while the joint symptoms may mimic sickle cell disease.Jones criteria is used for diagnosis of rheumatic fever.

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is the most common neurobehavioural disorder affecting children. It may present in infancy and can continue into adulthood. It affects 5-8% of children and nearly three times as many boys as girls. Nearly half the children presenting with ADHD may also have an associated learning problem.The term is commonly applied wrongly to the normal child who is always on the go and never sits still. Recognized causes of hyperactivity in children include normal variation, boredom or understimulation or excessive restraint, learning difficulties, autism, partial seizures and drugs like clonazepam, phenobarbitone and phenytoin.ADHD is also wrongly attributed to poor parenting, too much TV, poor schools, poor home environment, excess sugar or food allergies.No specific tests confirm a diagnosis of ADHD. A full physical and neurological examination must be done in all cases. The behavioural deficits and excesses that constitute a diagnosis of ADHD must be present in multiple settings such as home and school.CAUSESUnknownRelated factors:HereditaryImbalance of neurotransmittersSYMPTOMSInattentionchild often fails to finish things he or she startsoften does not seem to listenhas difficulty concentrating on school workImpulsivitychild often acts before thinkinghits others when upsetinability to wait for his or her turn in a gameengages in dangerous activities without consideration of the consequenceshas difficulty organizing work (this not due to cognitive impair- ment)Hyperactivitychild tries to do several things at oncetalks incessantly,struggles to sit still at a desk and fidgetsDistractibility is evidenced bynot listening when spoken toan inclination to daydreamnot being able to work independentlydisorganizedSIGNSSimilar to symptoms aboveINVESTIGATIONSUsually noneTREATMENT Treatment objectivesTo reduce hyperactivityTo improve attentionTo improve compliance to instructionNon-pharmacological treatmentBehaviour management techniques - Evidence Rating: [A]A class helper in class to sit with child and focus attention to school workParenting class to help parents copeDesist from punitive physical interventions e.g. caningPharmacological treatment 1st Line Treatment Evidence Rating: [A]Methylphenidate, oral,ADULTS10 mg 8-12 hourly (max. 60 mg)ThenIncrease weekly by 5-10 mg, if necessary, to max. of 30 mg 12 hourlyCHILDREN6-18 years; 2.5-5 mg 12 hourlyIncrease weekly by 5-10 mg, if necessary, to max. of 30 mg 12 hourly 4-6 years;  2.5 mg 12 hourlyIncrease weekly by 2.5 mg daily to max. of 1.4 mg/kg if necessary in 2 to 3 divided doses.< 4 years;  not recommendedOrAtomoxetine, oral,ADULTS40 mg once daily for 7 daysThenIncrease according to response to a max. of 100 mgCHILDREN>6 years (weight > 70 kg); 40 mg once daily for 7daysThenIncrease according to response to a max. of 80 mg>6 years (weight < 70 kg); 500 micrograms/kg daily for 7 daysThenIncrease according to response to a max. of 1.2 mg/kg daily< 6 years;  not recommended2nd Line Treatment Evidence Rating: [B]Imipramine, oral,ADULTS75 mg dailyThenIncrease to 150 mg daily if necessary (max. 200 mg per day)CHILDREN6-18 years; 10-30 mg 12 hourlyREFERRAL CRITERIARefer to a clinical psychologist for behaviour management.

Adrenal insufficiency arises when the adrenal gland is destroyed by disease, or atrophies following pituitary failure or chronic corticosteroid use or abuse. In these situations, the amount of cortisol produced from the adrenal gland is insufficient to meet the body's needs during periods of physical and psychological stress or severe illness. The condition is associated with severe fluid and electrolyte imbalance and results in acute circulatory collapse.CAUSESSudden cessation of prolonged corticosteroid use or abuse.Stress (e.g. infection, severe trauma, surgery, and dental procedures) in a patient with undiagnosed adrenal insufficiency or patients on prolonged corticosteroid treatment.Pituitary failureAuto-immune disease of the adrenal gland (Addison's disease)Severe infections affecting the adrenal gland (e.g. meningococcus, tuberculosis, HIV)Congenital adrenal hyperplasia in childrenSYMPTOMSNauseaVomitingWeaknessCollapseAbdominal painDiarrhoeaSIGNSDehydrationLow or unrecordable blood pressureDarkening of oral mucosa, gums, skin, palms and soles in some individualsEvidence of corticosteroid abuse e.g. skin bleaching, Cushingoid appearanceAmbiguous genitalia, short stature and failure to thrive in childrenVariable states of consciousnessINVESTIGATIONSFBC (may show anaemia and eosinophilia)Blood urea and electrolytes (may show high potassium)Blood glucose (may be low)Plasma cortisol (low)Blood film for malaria parasites, if indicatedUrine and blood cultures, if indicatedTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo correct the fluid and electrolyte imbalanceTo correct hypoglycaemiaTo replace corticosteroidsTo identify cause and treat any precipitating factorNon-pharmacological treatmentNonePharmacological treatmentA.

Caution 12-1Long-term corticosteroid therapy requires specialist supervision. Healthcare practitioners should inform patients of the following;Patients on corticosteroids should report to a hospital if they become ill and should tell their doctor, dentist, nurse or pharmacist that they are on corticosteroidsPatients SHOULD NOT stop treatment if they become ill, have an infection or are undergoing a dental procedure. Rather a doubling of the regular doses of corticosteroids is neededRevert to hydrocortisone, IV for even minor surgical procedures including labour and deliveryThe dose of corticosteroids must be reduced gradually if treatment has been for longer than 3 weeks and is to be stoppedDiscourage the abuse of oral or topical corticosteroids REFERRAL CRITERIAAll patients suspected to have adrenal insufficiency should be referred, after resuscitation, to a regional or teaching hospital for assessment and long-term management.





    
    
    

These occur following sudden withdrawal from alcohol. They are often seen 12 to 18 hours after the last drink, but may be earlier and   are worst between 24 to 48 hours after onset. This commonly occurs     in patients admitted to hospital for other problems e.g. arising from accidents or physical illnesses, which keeps them from drinking. The presentation varies from minimal tremors to states of full-blown agitation and confusion, which are potentially fatal.CAUSESAbrupt cessation or significant reduction in alcohol intake in an individual with heavy drinking over many months or years Minor WithdrawalAlcoholic HallucinosisAlcoholic SeizuresOnset12 to 18 hours after last drink, but may be earlier.

This is the most dramatic withdrawal syndrome. It usually starts 2-3 days after drinking stops. On average, the syndrome lasts 3 days but may continue for much longer. Without good supportive care and adequate treatment, Delirium Tremens (DT) is associated with significant mortality.Risk factors include long history of heavy alcohol use, previous history of DT, concurrent illness, significant alcohol level during withdrawal, long duration since last drink (over 48 hours) and age over 30 years.CAUSESSudden withdrawal of alcohol from a long-term chronic user of alcoholSYMPTOMSRestlessnessShaking of hands, whole limbs or bodySweatingConfusionInappropriate behaviourUnintelligible speechMisidentificationSeeing or talking to imaginary objectsSIGNSTremorsPsychomotor agitation or retardationSweatingVomitingDisorientationIntermittent visual, tactile or auditory hallucinations or illusions (Visual hallucinations are frequently of small objects or frightening 'animals' on walls etc.)Fever > 38°C.Pulse > 100 beats/minute, Blood Pressure > 160/100mmHgINVESTIGATIONSFull Blood CountLiver Function TestsScreen for malaria and common infectionsTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo relieve agitation and calm patientTo correct fluid and electrolyte imbalanceTo prevent complications like seizures, development of amnesia and encephalopathyTo prevent or manage heart complications if presentNon-pharmacological treatmentSeclusion of the patientApplication of restraints as necessaryPsychotherapy and psychoeducationPharmacological treatmentEvidence Rating: [A]A.

CHAPTER 2: DISORDERS OF THE LIVER8. Amoebic Liver AccessAmoebic liver abscess is a collection of typically brownish coloured fluid in the liver, occurring often as a single mass in the right lobe and a complication of intestinal infection with Entamoeba histolytica. Lung, heart and brain infections are uncommon sequelae. Occasionally, pyogenic abscesses may have a similar clinical presentation.Treatment of amoebic abscesses should be initiated with a tissue agent active against the trophozoite form followed by a luminal agent to eliminate intra-luminal cysts.CAUSESEntamoeba histolyticaSYMPTOMSRight upper abdominal pain referable to the epigastrium, right chest or right shoulderFeverMalaiseSweatsCoughHiccupsAnorexiaWeight lossJaundice (uncommon)Concurrent diarrhoea (less than one-third of patients) SIGNSLarge tender liverTenderness and/or bulging at right intercostal spacesJaundiceDullness to percussion on the right lower chest zones with basal crepitationsAmoebic empyema following extension into the chest cavityPeritonitis (uncommon) INVESTIGATIONSAbdominal ultrasoundChest X-rayFBCESRStool examinationAbdominal CT scanSerology (amoebic antibodies) TREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo eradicate Entamoeba histolytica infectionTo prevent further destruction of liver tissueTo prevent further complications (e.g. rupture of abscess into pleural, pericardial or peritoneal space) Non-pharmacological treatmentTherapeutic aspiration may be required in patients with poor response to therapy Pharmacological treatment1st Line Treatment Evidence Rating: [A]•  Metronidazole, oral,Adults  800 mg 8 hourly for 10 days (tissue agent)Children  15 mg/kg 8 hourly for 10 days (tissue agent)Then•  Diloxanide furoate, oral,Adults  500 mg 8 hourly for 10 days (luminal agent)Children  6-8 mg/kg 8 hourly for 10 days (luminal agent)2nd Line Treatment Evidence Rating: [A]•  Tinidazole, oral,Adults   2 g once daily for 5 days (tissue agent)Children   >3 years; 50 mg/kg (max. 2 g) once daily for 5 days (tissue agent)Then•  Paromomycin, oral,Adults  8-10 mg/kg 8 hourly for 7 days (luminal agent)Children  8-10 mg/kg 8 hourly for 7 days (luminal agent) REFERRAL CRITERIA Patients with abscesses that are large or not responding to treatment will need to be referred to a specialist.





    
    
    

Anaemia is defined as decreased concentration of haemoglobin for the age and sex of the individual (i.e. below 13 g/dL in adult males, 12 g/dL in adult females, 11 g/dL in children, and below 13.5 g/dL in the 1st week of life). Anaemia always has a cause, which must be identified and properly managed.  The cause must be investigated before initiating treatment.

ANAEMIA IN CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASEAnaemia develops early in the course of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and is nearly universal in patients with CKD stage 5 (End-stage kidney disease).The prevalence of anaemia at higher levels of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (i.e. CKD stage 1-2) is relatively low in individuals from the general population. Anaemia of CKD is primarily caused by deficiency of erythropoietin. The kidneys are the major source of erythropoietin and, as renal function declines, production of erythropoietin declines proportionately.Though erythropoietin deficiency is common among patients with anaemia in CKD, other potential causes and contributing disorders should be identified or excluded if initial evaluation yields evidence for disorders other than iron deficiency or erythropoietin deficiency. Correction of anaemia in CKD patients improves survival and quality of life.CAUSESDeficiency of erythropoietinRed cell destruction from microvascular disease from diabetes or hypertensionIncreased gastrointestinal bleedingIncreased oxidative stress leading to shortened red cell survivalSYMPTOMS(See section on 'Anaemia')SIGN(See section on 'Anaemia')INVESTIGATIONSFBCReticulocyte countTransferrin saturationSerum ferritinStool occult bloodTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo achieve and maintain a target-range Hb level of 11-12 g/dLNon-pharmacological treatment(See section on 'Anaemia')Pharmacological treatmentCKD Stages 1-21st Line Treatment Evidence Rating: [A]Ferrous sulphate, oral, 325 mg 8 hourly for 4 weeksCKD Stages 3-4Iron replacement: Target Hb should be 11-12 g/dLFerrous sulphate, oral, 325 mg 8 hourlyOrFerrous gluconate, oral, 300 mg 8-12 hourly.

ANAEMIA IN PREGNANCY
Anaemia in pregnancy is a haemoglobin concentration of < 11 g/ dL (World Health Organisation). It is described as severe if the Hb is < 7 g/dL. Anaemia has adverse effects on the health of the woman and the outcome of the pregnancy. It is associated with an increased rate of miscarriage, preterm delivery, foetal growth restriction, foetal death and increased perinatal loss. It is also associated with ante- and post-partum haemorrhage and an increased maternal mortality rate.
Ideally no woman should go into labour with anaemia. Appropriate measures including blood transfusion may be required to correct the anaemia especially if a woman is close to her expected delivery date.
CAUSES

Physiological (due to blood volume expansion in pregnancy)
Poor dietary intake of iron, folate and vitamin B12
Haemolytic disorders (e.g. sickle cell disease, G6PD defect)
Malaria
Infestations with hookworm, ascaris, schistosomes
Chronic infections e.g. TB, UTI, HIV
Bleeding complications in pregnancy g. APH
SYMPTOMS
Dizziness
Swelling of the feet
General weakness
Easy fatiguability

SIGNS

Mucosal pallor
Jaundice (may or may not be present)
Hepato-splenomegaly (may or may not be present)
Heart failure in severe cases

INVESTIGATIONS

FBC
Peripheral blood film comment
Blood film for malaria parasites
Sickling and Hb electrophoresis
G6PD activity
Serum iron, total iron binding capacity, ferritin
Stool analysis for hookworm ova
Urinalysis for schistosoma ova and urobilinogen

TREATMENT
Treatment objectives

To relieve symptoms
To correct haemoglobin level before patient reaches term or goes

into labour

To identify and treat underlying cause
To recognize and manage the associated complications in mother

e.g. cardiac failure, and baby e.g. intrauterine growth restriction
Non-pharmacological treatment

Encourage intake of foods such as red meat, poultry, fish, dark

leafy vegetables, shell fish, dried fruits which are rich in iron, folate, Vitamins B and C

Avoid tea, coffee, bran, cola and unhealthy habits such as eating of clay, which inhibits iron absorption
Encourage intake of folate and vitamin rich foods including beans, avocado, citrus fruits, spinach and mangoes
Protein rich foods must also be included in the diet
Ensure these anemic patients are seen more frequently in the antenatal clinic and their response to treatment monitored with haemoglobin level checks.

            Note 13-3
        
        
            In severe anaemia (Hb < 7 g/dL), blood transfusion may be necessary. In labour severe anaemia is best treated by blood transfusion
        
    

Add

Furosemide IV, 20-40 mg if giving whole blood

REFERRAL CRITERIA
Refer patients with anaemia to a dietician or diet nurse for counselling and support. Treatment for severe anaemia (Hb < 7g/dL) is best given in health facilities with blood transfusion capability. All women who do not respond satisfactorily to oral treatment should be referred for further evaluation. Those with associated conditions like HIV and Haemogobinopathies should be managed in the hospital. HIV patients on antiretroviral medication may need modification of their drug combinations to exclude those that aggravate anaemia e.g. zidovudine.

The pain threshold may be low during labour on account of fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Adequatepain relief duringlabour results in less anxiety and good progress.In the first stage of labour pain relief may be required for painful uterine contractions, whereas in the second stage of labour, analgesia is required for instrumental delivery and when an episiotomy is given.Pharmacological treatmentA.

ANTENATAL CARE
Antenatal care refers to the comprehensive care given to a pregnant woman to ensure that she goes through pregnancy, labour and the puerperium safely with the delivery of a healthy baby.
The recommended approach to antenatal care is known as Focused Antenatal Care. It has the following principles: emphasizes quality of care rather than quantity of care (four comprehensive antenatal visits recommended for women with normal pregnancy); individualized care that meets each woman's own medical and psychosocial needs; and disease detection instead of risk categorization based on the simple principle that all pregnant women are at risk of complications.
Pregnant woman should be carefully assessed at booking and at all subsequent visits to identify problems that are likely to have an adverse effect on the pregnancy. Pregnancies with risk conditions (one or more risk factors) should be seen more frequently and also referred to a hospital and/or obstetrician for management.
Another important component of antenatal care is the health education and counselling that is given to clients. These promote healthy behaviour and lifestyle during the pregnancy and also enable the woman to recognize danger signs in pregnancy and prepare adequately for emergencies and safe delivery. Findings at each visit should be accurately documented.
Antenatal Visits Schedule for a Normal Healthy Woman
Women who are healthy at booking and who remain healthy at subsequent visits and do not have any identified potential risk conditions may have four comprehensive visits as follows:

    
    

    
    
More frequent visits or follow up schedules are implemented to meet the client's individual needs.
In Ghana, many clients come for their first visit during their second trimester of pregnancy. In this case, the visit schedule must be modified to ensure that the client receives all the essential components of care before childbirth.
Assessment of the mother at the booking visit

Take detailed history (present health, past medical and surgical history, past obstetric history, family and social history)
Confirm the last menstrual period and established gestational age
Examine from head to toe and all body systems including a check for anaemia, blood pressure, pulse, general health status and manage appropriately
Conduct obstetric examination to confirm pregnancy, measure uterine size (SFH) and assess foetal wellbeing (FHR).
Request for/ conduct screening test as per national protocol (See list of investigations)

Assessment of the mother at follow-up visits:

Ask about mother's health status since last visit and ask about health

concerns

Enquire about foetal activity (gestation > 20 weeks)
Test urine for albumin and sugar
Examine mother for weight gain, anaemia, and for complications such as pre-eclampsia and manage appropriately
Check blood pressure (the upper limit of normal is 140 mmHg for the systolic pressure and 90 mmHg for the diastolic pressure).
Obstetric examination:
Measure Uterine size: measure symphysio-fundal height in cen- timetres between 20 and 36 weeks
Check the lie, presentation and position of the baby and the descent of the presenting part (3rd trimester). Check the foetal heart sounds. Normal rate is 120-160 beats per minute.

 
 
 
 
INVESTIGATIONS

Antibiotic prophylaxis refers to the administration of antibiotics in patients to reduce the risk of perioperative sepsis. The main cause of morbidity and mortality in surgery is infectious complications.Antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated in cases where sepsis is expected and could have disastrous local or generalised effects.For prophylaxis to be effective, antibiotics must be given before contamination takes place or at the earliest possible time before infection is established. For surgery, therefore, it must be given IV about the time of induction of anaesthesia, so that tissues are saturated with the antibiotic before contamination occurs.CAUSESStaphylococcus aureusStreptococcus spp.Enterobacteriaceae (GI)Anaerobes (GI)Coagulase negative staphylococci (especially cardiac surgery, and implantation surgery), etc.OBJECTIVESPrevent infectionsPrevent complicationsINDICATIONSProven IndicationsAcute appendicitis and intestinal obstructionSurgery on the colon and rectumSurgery on the biliary tractGastro-oesophageal and oro-pharyngeal surgery for carcinomaHysterectomySurgery in the presence of pusPatients with rheumatic heart diseasePatients with congenital heart diseaseAccepted IndicationsImplant surgery where prosthesis and device implants are usedCardiovascular surgeryCaesarean sectionPossible IndicationsThoracic surgeryNeurosurgerySurgery on the genito-urinary tractTrauma surgeryCHOICE OF ANTIBIOTICSThe antibiotic chosen must:Have antibacterial activity against the anticipated pathogensNot easily induce antimicrobial resistanceHave a high concentration at the site of infectionBe safely metabolised and excretedHave few toxic or adverse reactionsBe affordable

Anxiety is a common symptom that occurs in all psychiatric disorders including depressive illness and most psychoses. Physical diseases like hyperthyroidism, cardiac disease or hypertension may also present with anxiety and therefore must be excluded.There are various forms of anxiety disorders (e.g. generalized anxiety disorders, panic disorders, phobias, obsessive compulsive disorder, acute stress disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, etc.), but the common ones seen in general practice are generalized anxiety disorders and panic disorders.In all cases of suspected anxiety disorders, it is important to assess the scope of the anxiety, including the antecedents, behaviour and consequences of anxiety for the patient through an indepth interview. It is also important to ask about the presence of obsessive thoughts and/ or compulsions as these are increasingly common and tend not to be reported out of embarrassment but which lead to much personal distress. In this case refer to a psychiatrist.In generalized anxiety disorders, there is excessive anxiety and worry about events or activities, such as performance at school or work, occurring on most days, for at least 6 months.A panic disorder refers to a pattern of recurrent unexpected  attacks of intense fear or discomfort over a discrete period more than    3 times a week. During attacks 4 or more of the symptoms listed below develop abruptly and reach a peak within 10 minutes. Panic disorders are accompanied by persistent concern about having another attack or worrying about implications of having an attack.In children especially, partial complex seizures may mimic panic attacks. Medications are required to treat panic disorders only if the attacks occur frequently enough to cause distress.GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDERSCAUSESMultiple negative life experiencesEnvironmental factorsPersonality traitGenetic predispositionSYMPTOMSExcessive anxiety and worry occurring on most days, for at least 6 monthsAnxiety or worry associated with at least 3 of the following:Muscle tension (often reported as pain in various parts like neck, trunk or headaches)Crawling and burning sensation around the bodyRestlessness or feeling on edgeBeing easily fatiguedDifficulty concentrating or mind going blankIrritabilitySleep disturbance (difficulty falling asleep or frequent wakening)PalpitationsSIGNSRestlessnessSweatingAnxious moodTachycardiaTremorsINVESTIGATIONSNone to confirm the diagnosis.Tests to exclude probable differential diagnoses such as hyperthyroidism, phaeochromocytoma, cardiac arrhythmias etc.TREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo reduce anxietyTo attain relief of somatic symptomsNon-pharmacological treatmentReassurance about the absence of physical disease once they are ruled outTeach relaxation methodsEncourage regular physical exercise if possibleEncourage healthy social activitiesCognitive Behaviour TherapyPharmacological treatmentA.

Arrhythmias are disorders of cardiac rate, rhythm and conduction. They can be classified as bradyarrhythmias (heart rate < 60 per minute) and tachyarrhythmias (heart rate > 100 per minute).Bradyarrhythmias include sinus bradycardia, sinus pauses and atrioventricular blocks. The tachyarrhythmias can further be classified into supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, based on their site   of origin. Tachyarrhythmias include atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. Prior to drug treatment of a suspected cardiac arrhythmia, a 12-lead ECG must be done to confirm the rhythm abnormality. It is dangerous  to use an antiarrhythmic drug without doing an ECG. Refer symptomatic patients to hospital immediately. The choice of drug treatment depends on the type of arrhythmia and severity of symptoms.CAUSES • Rheumatic heart disease • Other valvular heart diseases • Hypertensive heart disease • Ischaemic heart disease • Thyrotoxicosis • Hypothyroidism • Cardiomyopathies • Complete heart block • Electrolyte abnormalities particularly hypokalaemia • Pericardial disease • Drugs • Smoking, alcohol, coffee, tea, etc. • Pulmonary embolism • Post cardiac surgery • IdiopathicSYMPTOMS • Palpitations • Dizziness • Chest discomfort/pain • Fatigue • Difficulty in breathing • Sudden collapse • Sudden deathSIGNS • Pulse• Rate may be fast, slow or normal• Rhythm•  Pulse deficit (apical rate faster than radial pulse rate; seen in fast atrial fibrillation or flutter)•  Hypotension or blood pressure may be unrecordable•  Signs of heart failure (may be present) INVESTIGATIONS12-lead ECGSerum electrolytes (including magnesium, calcium)Thyroid function testsChest X-rayAmbulatory ECG (Holter)EchocardiographyTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo control ventricular rateTo restore sinus rhythmTo relieve symptomsTo improve functional capacity and quality of lifeTo prevent or treat associated complicationsTo treat the underlying condition e.g. thyrotoxicosisTo prevent stroke or systemic thromboembolismTo reduce morbidity and mortalityNon-pharmacological treatmentReassure the patientAvoid excessive intake of alcohol, coffee or tea and stop smoking (if these are possible precipitating factors)Massage of the carotid sinus on one side for a few seconds.

Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by qualitative impairments occurring in a child before the age of 36 months, in three key areas; social interaction (often the earliest features of Autistic Spectrum Disorder-ASD), communication, interests and activities.The clinical presentation is varied and may encompass  children with severe manifestations of the above features or with more subtle behavioural deficits, hence the use of the term Autistic Spectrum Disorder. Learning disability in this condition is very common and the risk of epilepsy is significant.ASD is increasingly being recognized in Ghana.CAUSESNo clear aetiologyGeneticSYMPTOMSAbsence of joint attention (i.e. failure to show interest, follow gaze, lack of social smiling and limited use of gestures e.g. shaking head, waving or clapping)Communication deficitReceptive: fails to acquire language or delays in understanding languageExpressive: delays in use of languageLimited range of interests (limited play with toys and other objects)Repetitive activities (e.g. spinning objects)Global developmental delays (e.g. walking, speech etc.)Learning difficultiesAttention deficitSleeping difficultiesFeeding difficultiesSIGNSLack of pointing to objects by 24 monthsNo single words by 18 monthsNo two word spontaneous phrase by 24 monthsLoss of languageAvoidance of eye contactINVESTIGATIONSUsually none requiredElectroencephalogram (EEG) if seizures suspectedBrain CT or MRI only in special circumstances e.g. abnormal physical features presentTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo correct social communication difficulties using a multidisciplinary behavioural and educational approachNon-pharmacological treatmentApplied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) - teaching based on teacher request, prompt assistance to child, child response and feedbackPharmacological treatmentA.

ABNORMAL VAGINAL BLEEDINGThis refers to bleeding which deviates from the normal menstrual pattern (in terms of the amount, duration or interval). Abnormal menstrual patterns and bleeding are common in young adolescents and women within the ages of 45-50 years. No cause may be found on investigation in these age groups as it is mostly due to immaturity or ageing of the ovaries and its pituitary controls. Bleeding may be mild or severe and life threatening. In other age groups, the causes are multiple and may be associated with the identifiable disorders. Postmenopausal bleeding is said to occur when a woman who has stopped having menstruation for 6-12 or more months begins to bleed per vagina. 0ccasionally bleeding from the rectum and urethra may be confused with genital tract bleeding. Treatment is directed at the cause found.CAUSESPre-pubertal girlsUrethral mucosal prolapseCoital lacerations due to rape and defilementTraumaYoung AdolescentsDysfunctional uterine bleedingComplications of pregnancyCoital lacerations due to rape and defilementAccidental traumatic lesions of vulva and vaginaWomen of Child Bearing AgeComplications of pregnancy, including ectopic pregnancy, abortion and choriocarcinomaCoital lacerationsUse of hormonal methods of contraception or intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD)Cervical cancerFibroidsDysfunctional bleedingPeri-menopausal WomenDysfunctional uterine bleedingAll other causes listed for women of childbearing age also applyPost-menopausal WomenPelvic cancers such as cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, vaginal or vulva cancer and ovarian tumoursWithdrawal from oestrogen therapyAtrophic vaginitisEndometritisCoital tearsUrethral caruncleSYMPTOMSVaginal bleeding which deviates from normal menstrual patternMay be associated lower abdominal pain or dysmenorrhoeaSymptoms of anaemia (dizziness, palpitations, easy fatigue etc.)SIGNSSigns of anaemia (if heavy bleeding)Other signs related to causeINVESTIGATIONSFBCSickling testBlood clotting screen e.g. Prothrombin time, INRPelvic ultrasound scan (to rule out pelvic lesions)UrinalysisDiagnostic Dilatation and Curettage (DD & C) for women of child bearing age and postmenopausal womenTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo resuscitate patient where necessaryTo find the cause of bleedingTo treat and stop the bleedingNon-pharmacological treatmentVaginal coital tear - suturing in theatreInevitable or incomplete abortion - uterine evacuationSurgery (myomectomy, hysterectomy, oophorectomy etc.)Radiation therapy for cancersPharmacological treatmentDysfunctional uterine bleeding - mild bleeding1st Line Treatment Evidence Rating: [B]Norethisterone acetate, oral, 5 mg 8 hourly for 10-12 days (to stop bleeding)Then5 mg 12 hourly (days 19 to 26 of cycle to prevent bleeding)2nd Line Treatment Evidence Rating: [B]Mefenamic Acid, oral, 500 mg 8 hourly on days 1 to 5 of cycle (Especially if associated with dysmenorrhoea)Life threatening bleeding 1st Line Treatment Evidence Rating: [A]IV fluids and blood transfusion as requiredAndEvidence Rating: [A]Tranexamic Acid, oral or IV, 1 g 6-8 hourly for 4-7 days2nd Line Treatment Evidence Rating: [B]Mefenamic Acid, slow IV injection, 500 mg 8 hourly(days 1 to 5 of cycle)For recurrent or protracted abnormal bleeding1st Line Treatment Evidence Rating [A]Low dose oral contraceptive pill daily for 3-6 cycles or longerEthinylestradiol + levonorgestrelOrEthinylestradiol + norethisterone2nd Line Treatment Evidence Rating: [C]Conjugated oestrogen, oral, 1.25-2.5 mg daily for 10-12 daysAndEvidence Rating: [A]Norethisterone, oral,5-10 mg 8 hourly for 21 days (days 5-25)OrEvidence Rating: [B]Medroxyprogesterone acetate, oral, 5-10 mg daily for 5-10 days (days 19 to 26 of cycle)REFERRAL CRITERIARefer all women with heavy menstrual bleeding and/or abnormal vaginal bleeding not responding to therapy to a gynaecologist for comprehensive assessment and management.  





    
    
    

ABNORMAL VAGINAL DISCHARGEWhile a vaginal discharge is a notable clinical feature of a Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI),not all forms of vaginal discharge are abnormal or indicative of an STI. Vaginal discharge may be associated with normal physiological changes such as the menstrual cycle or pregnancy. Increased discharge may also occur with the presence or use of foreign substances such as the Intra Uterine Contraceptive Device (IUCD).Careful history taking should reveal whether a vaginal discharge is abnormal and if it is associated with use of chemical substances e.g. topical self-medication, repeated douching with abrasive substances or indeed due to STI. Changes in the characteristics of a woman's vaginal discharge either in colour, odour, amount and presence of additional symptoms and signs such as soreness and itchiness indicate a need for medical attention. Abnormal vaginal discharge due to STIs may result in serious pelvic inflammation with sequelae such as ectopic pregnancy and infertility. Careful risk assessment is therefore required (see note below) of women presenting with a vaginal discharge in order to identify the possible causes and provide appropriate treatment regimens based on the most likely aetiology of the vaginal discharge. Factors that must also be considered when selecting treatment for patients include pregnancy status and patient discomfort. Additionally, the syndromic approach must be used to assess the patient, identify risk factors and treat the likely cause of infection.

Back pain This is the commonest cause of reported pain to healthcare facilities. More than 80% of people will have at least one episode in their lifetime. Most are benign and will resolve. However, 33%-66% will have a recurrence within a year. It is important to identify red, and yellow flags. It may be acute if it is less than 3 months and chronic if it is more.Box 22-1: Notes of back painYELLOW flagsPessimistic attitude toward pain, excessive fear of movement and activity and little hope for improvementWork-related problems(e.g. dissatisfaction, conflicts)Emotional problems (e.g. depression, anxiety, worry)Generalized pain (e.g. headache, fatigue, dizziness)Desire for passive treatment, little ability to be proactivePrevious episodes of low back pain that were followed for an extended period of timeRED flagsPatients < 20 years or > 55 years of age experiencing back pain for the  first timePatients experiencing pain significantly  different from previous episodesPain that is constant over time and does not disappear during sleepGeneral malaise and poor general conditionTraumatic injuries, tumors, steroid use or improper use of immunosuppressantNeurological compromiseSpinal deformity Pronounced morning stiffness lasting for longer than 1 hour and/or high erythrocyte sedimentation rateCAUSES Mechanical (e.g. disc degeneration, fractured vertebrae, instability, unknown cause [most cases])Neurogenic (e.g., herniated disc, spinal stenosis, osteophyte damage to nerve root)Non-mechanical spinal conditions (e.g., neoplasm, infections, inflammatory arthritis, Paget’s disease)Referred visceral pain(e.g. Gastrointestinal disease, kidney disease, abdominal aortic aneurism)Other(e.g. Fibromyalgia, somatoform disorder, "faking “pain)SYMPTOMSPainNociceptiveDiffuse painNeuropathicPricking, tingling, pins and needlesElectric shocks of shootingHot or burningNumbnessAltered sensationRadicular painIncontinence of urine and faecesSIGNSDeformity of spineTenderness in affected regionWeakness of the affected limbMuscle wasting in the affected limbAltered sensation in the affected limbINVESTIGATIONS

BACTERIAL PROSTATITISProstatitis is inflammation of the prostate gland, which may be bacterial or abacterial. Bacterial prostatitis is more common than abacterial prostatitis. It may present as an acute condition which may either be sexually transmitted or result from urethral reflux of infected urine into the prostatic ducts. 0ther potential sources may be bacteria spread from rectum or bloodstream. If inadequately treated this may progress to chronic prostatitis. It is more common in men below below 50 years.

BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIABenign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) refers to non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland which results in obstruction of urine flow from the bladder. BPH is the commonest cause of male urinary symptoms in Ghana. The average age at which lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) related to BPH occurs is about 50 years. Men may seek treatment for LUTS either because the symptoms are bothersome or they feel that it may lead to acute urinary retention or out of fear that it may be an indication of prostate cancer. It is important to establish what the patient wants from the consultation. In some patients, once reassured that the likelihood of urinary retention and prostate cancer is low, they may not wish treatment. for the symptoms. Currently available medicines can either relax prostatic smooth muscles or cause reduction in the prostate size and therefore ease the symptoms of BPH. A combination of available medications, especially in patients with a prostate size more than 40 ml, produce better responses than monotherapy. BPH may lead to complications such as recurrent urinary tract infection, acute urine retention with painful distension of the bladder, chronic urine retention with painless gross distension of the bladder, haematuria, and renal failure.

Bipolar disorder is a form of mood disorder. The term refers to a condition in which patients experience mood swings between the two extremes of depression and mania. Bipolar disorder is referred to in older literature as manic-depressive illness. It is important to note that the affected patient usually presents with one predominant mood state at a time, either depression or mania.A single manic episode and a history of depression qualify for classification as bipolar disorder. A current episode of depression without a past manic episode is not diagnosed as a bipolar disorder. Repeated depressive episodes are diagnosed as recurrent depression.CAUSESLargely unknownPossible associations:Tendency to run in familiesGenetic factorsSYMPTOMSPersistently elevated mood:- euphoria, expansiveness, feeling 'high' or irritableOveractivityTalking fast and excessivelyGrandiose claimsReduced sleepReckless spending and being overly generousSexual and social disinhibitionAuditory hallucinations, in severe cases (patients may hear voices, often reinforcing their                    grandiose beliefs)Undue suspicion (paranoia) may existImpaired judgementSIGNSNone typical of bipolar disorderSame as symptoms aboveINVESTIGATIONSUsually no specific investigationsRarely, thyrotoxicosis may mimic mania and must be excludedTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo treat symptoms of mania or depression, whichever is present with current episodeTo reduce the level of activity in mania to a manageable stateTo elevate mood to a normal state in depressionTo abolish psychotic symptoms (delusions and hallucinations), if presentNon-pharmacological treatmentPsychotherapyPsychoeducationPharmacological treatmentA.

SNAKE BITEMost snake bites are non-poisonous. Vipers are the commonest cause of poisonous snake bites in tropical Africa. Others are the cobras and water snakes. All cases of snake bites (venomous/non-venomous) should be observed for at least 6 hours. Identify the type of snake if possible. Don't rely too much on fang marks; however multiple fang marks usually indicate a non-poisonous bite whereas one or two fang marks suggest a poisonous bite. It is important to determine whether envenomation has occurred. The role of tourniquets and incision over the site of the bite are controversial issues and are to be avoided.CAUSESSnakesSYMPTOMSPainBleedingSwellingFaintingDark-coloured urineHeadacheMuscle acheFearLoss of consciousnessSIGNS(Poisonous snake bites) Cardiovascular:Hypotension, shock, cardiac arrhythmiasSpontaneous systemic bleeding, from bite site, mucosa and old wounds, haematuriaDark urine from myoglobinuria and intravascular haemolysisNeuromuscular:Cranial nerve paralysis - ptosis, opthalmoplegia, slurred speechBulbar respiratory paralysis - drooling, and inability to breath properlyImpaired consciousness, seizuresMeningismTender and stiff musclesLocal effects:Rapid progression of swelling to more than half of bitten limbBlistering, necrosis and bruisingFascial compartmentalisation on bitten digitsINVESTIGATIONSFull blood countRenal function test20 minutes whole blood clotting test (leave 2-5 ml of blood in dried test tube.

BLADDER CANCERBladder cancer is the second commonest urological cancer after prostate cancer. It is the commonest of all the cancers, which affect the urinary tract lining (urothelium). Males are more affected than females in a ratio of about 3:1. It is more common in the white race compared  to the black race in a ratio of 4:1. More than 80% of clients with bladder cancer are above 50 years. The commonest pathological types aretransitional cell carcinoma TCC (90%), Squamous cell carcinoma (8%) and adenocarcinoma and carcinoma in-situ (2%).CAUSESChronic Infections of the bladder like Schistosoma haematobium(Bilharzia) and chronic bacterial infectionsSmoking of cigarettes: cancer usually develops 10-20 years after smoking and 20 sticks a day/a packet carries a high risk of cancer development.

Bleeding disorders may present at birth or develop later in life. The bleeding may be spontaneous or follow trauma or surgery and may be due to defective blood vessels, platelet disorders or clotting factor deficiency. Past episodes of excessive bleeding e.g. following circumcision, a family history of bleeding and drug therapy may be important clues to the diagnosis.The pattern of bleeding is a helpful guide to its cause. In platelet and vessel wall defects, bleeding is usually into skin and mucosal surfaces like the gums, nose, gastrointestinal tract, whereas in coagulation factor deficiency (e.g. haemophilia), bleeding is into deep tissues like the brain, joints and muscles.In newborns with vitamin K deficiency (which leads to multiple coagulation factor deficiency) spontaneous bleeding occurs from various sites such as the umbilical cord, gastrointestinal tract, scalp and brain.CAUSESHaemophiliaVon Willebrand diseaseLiver diseaseVitamin K deficiency especially in newbornsBone marrow failure e.g. aplastic anaemia and leukaemiaLow platelet count from any causeDisseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) from any causeDrug induced - herbal preparations, aspirin, clopidogrel, warfarin, rivaroxaban, heparinSYMPTOMSSpontaneous bleeding from mucous membranes or cutsEasy bruising, bleeding from orificesExcessive bleeding from cuts or incisionsDeformed joints from recurrent joint bleedsSwelling at site of blood collection (pseudotumours)Pain limiting movementSIGNSPallorExcessive bleedingLocalised swelling due to bleeding into body spaces e.g. JointsTendernessLimitation of movement and joint deformitiesPurpura, petechiae, ecchymosisINVESTIGATIONSFBC and blood film commentPlatelet countLiver function testsProthrombin time, INR, partial thromboplastin timeBleeding time TREATMENT Treatment objectivesTo prevent or arrest bleedingTo identify and correct underlying causeNon-pharmacological treatmentApply regulated pressure dressing and/or ice packs to minimise bleeding where possibleStop any event/drugs responsible for bleeding or which may aggravate bleedingEducate haemophiliacs on their disease, encouraging them to minimise trauma-prone activities, and to inform doctors of their condition before any surgical procedureAvoid unnecessary injections and surgical procedures in all patients (especially, those with a family history of bleeding tendencies)Physiotherapy on affected jointsSurgeryPharmacological treatmentA.

BOILSA boil or furuncle is a deep bacterial infection of the hair follicles. A more superficial infection is termed folliculitis. Several boils grouped in an area and discharging pus from several points is termed a carbuncle. Patients with recurrent boils or carbuncles should be screened for diabetes mellitus and skin disorders such as scabies, pediculosis or eczema while patients with repeated folliculitis in the shaving areas, e.g. face and armpits should be educated on shaving techniques.

Breast cancer is the commonest cancer affecting women. Early detection of this cancer is possible through monthly breast self- examination and is recommended for women of child-bearing age.Periodic screening through clinical breast examination is required for women below 40 years (1 in every 3 years) and yearly for women above 40 years. Mammography is recommended every 2 years for women 40 years and above.Five treatment modalities are available, but each patient's treatment is personalized and depends on the biological characteristics of the tumour, stage of disease and other patient factors.

Bronchial AsthmaAsthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the bronchial airways, which manifests as recurrent episodes of wheeze, cough, chest tightness and shortness of breath, which is usually reversible with treatment. It is characterised by increased sensitivity to many environmental agents. Asthma is variable and may be associated with seasons like the rainy season or harmattan. Bronchial asthma occurs at all ages but peaks in childhood. It is classified as an allergic disease, and may be associated with a personal or family history of allergic rhinitis (hay fever), eczema or allergic conjunctivitis.Complications of asthma include pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema and pneumonia. CAUSES Allergens e.g. house dust mite, cockroach droppings, grass, pollen and animal hair Environmental factors e.g. air pollution, climatic changes, strong scents and smoke (including cigarette smoke and car fumes) Viral infections Exercise Emotions and hyperventilation Drugs e.g. aspirin, NSAIDS and beta-blockers such as propranolol Occupational exposure to industrial chemicals, dust and drug manufacturingSYMPTOMSEpisodic breathlessnessTightness of the chestCough - often nocturnalWheezeNocturnal symptoms.

 BronchiectasisIn bronchiectasis, the medium and smaller sized bronchi and bronchioles are damaged. Their ciliated epithelium is destroyed by inflammation and scarring, which in a vicious cycle of infection and further scarring leads to permanent dilatation and bronchial wall thickening. The mucus lining of these airways become colonized by bacteria and generate copious amounts of purulent and often offensive sputum. The disease,  if not treated is characterized by frequent infective exacerbations with progressively worsening lung function.CAUSES • Childhood pneumonia e.g. whooping cough, post measles • Post-pulmonary tuberculosis • Chronic rhinosinusitis with post-nasal drip • Asthma and COPD • Fibrosing lung disease of any cause e.g. rheumatoid lung disease • Immune deficiency states e.g. HIV infection, agammaglobulinaemia • Inherited disorders e.g. cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia should be considered in young children presenting with bronchiectasisSYMPTOMS • Persistent cough over many months • Copious purulent sputum which is sometimes offensive • Haemoptysis in over one third of cases during exacerbations • Intermittent systemic symptoms - fever, night sweats and weight loss • Chest pain • Difficulty in breathingSIGNSWeight lossFeverClubbingDull percussion noteBronchial breath soundsCoarse crepitationsINVESTIGATIONSFBC, ESRSputum culture and sensitivity, gram stainSputum AFBsChest X-rayCT scan of the chestPulse oximetry  TREATMENT Treatment objectivesTo treat infectionTo aid sputum clearanceTo minimize cough and sputum productionTo prevent exacerbationsTo diagnose and treat underlying disordersNon-pharmacological treatmentChest physiotherapy - Postural drainage, Sputum clearance techniquesBreathing exercisesImprove nutritionEncourage adequate fluid intakeEncourage physical exercisePharmacological treatmentA.

A burn is basically destruction of the skin. In certain situations deeper tissues such as subcutaneous tissue, muscle and bone may be involved. The burn may be superficial or deep depending on the extent of the injury. This condition, which can have devastating effects on affected people, can be prevented most of the time.

BURULI ULCERThis is a chronic painless necrotizing ulcer with undermined edges, which can lead to debilitating skin and soft tissue infection and permanent disfigurement. While it is known that this ulcer is caused by a bacterium, the mode of transmission remains unclear. However, trauma, insect bite and inhalation have been suggested.When detected early, the majority can be cured with a combination of antibiotics. Thus, early identification and appropriate management reduce morbidity and disability from this condition.

CARDIAC DISEASE IN PREGNANCY
Cardiac diseases are associated with high maternal and foetal mortality and morbidity. They may be present before the pregnancy or develop during the pregnancy or puerperium (e.g. peripartum cardiomyopathy). Pregnancy places additional burden on the heart and makes pre-existing cardiac disease worse.
Some of the signs of pregnancy may mimic cardiac disease. Careful assessment of all patients must be undertaken to determine if they have cardiac disease or not.
Management requires a multi-disciplinary team including the obstetrician, neonatologist, anaesthetist and physician specialist or cardiologist. Patients with known cardiac disease must plan their pregnancies carefully in full consultation with their cardiologist and obstetrician. They must book early as soon as they become pregnant for antenatal care in hospital. All patients needing pharmacological treatment must be managed by a physician specialist or cardiologist and obstetrician.

CARCINOMA OF THE CERVIXCarcinoma of the cervix is the commonest form of female genital cancer seen in Ghana. While the disease is preventable, in Ghana, the absence of an effective screening system has resulted in most cases presenting late with advanced disease. In developed countries, the incidence of cervical cancer has fallen considerably due to regular screening procedures (e.g. Pap smear, visual inspection with acetic acid, Human Papilloma Virus [HPV] test). Vaccination against cancer-causing HPV infection is the ideal method for primary prevention of cervical cancer. Treatment of cervical cancer requires the services of a gynaecological oncologist and radiotherapist. Treatment includes surgery and/or radiation and/or chemotherapy. Surgery involves removal of the central tumour as well as the lymphatics draining the area (Wertheim's hysterectomy). This extensive surgery should be carried out only by trained specialists. Radiation treatment often involves localized pelvic irradiation.CAUSESHuman papilloma virus (accounts for 80% of cases)Associated risk factors include:Sexual promiscuityMultiple child birthsInfections with Herpes Simplex Hominis type II, HIVSmokingLow socio-economic statusFamily historySYMPTOMSAsymptomatic (diagnosed on routine cervical screening)Symptomatic (advanced disease)Abnormal vaginal bleedingIn between regular menstrual periodsAfter sexual intercoursePost-menopausal bleedingAbnormal vaginal dischargeLower abdominal painPain during sexual intercourseWeight lossUrinary symptoms e.g. dysuria, frequency, incontinenceRectal painSIGNEarly disease: Erosion of cervix or changes of chronic cervicitisLate/advanced disease: Ulcerative or fungating cervical lesion on speculum examinationINVESTIGATIONSCervical biopsyFBC and sickling statusBlood urea and electrolytesSerum CreatinineSerum uric acidChest X-rayUltrasound of KidneysCT Scan and or Magnetic Resonance Imaging(to detect aortic nodes and metastases to the lungs and liver)Pelvic examination under anaesthesiaCystoscopy and proctoscopy with or without biopsy to allow visualisation of vesical or rectal mucosaTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo treat central tumourTo treat areas of tumour spread with the aim of eradicating the diseaseNon-pharmacological treatmentSurgeryRadiotherapyA combination of surgery, and radiotherapyPharmacological treatmentEvidence Rating: [A]Adjuvant chemotherapy (See section on referral below)REFERRAL CRITERIAAll patients must be referred to a specialist for evaluation to decide on stage of disease and best mode of treatment.

CHICKEN POXChicken pox and shingles are caused by the same virus (Varicella   or Herpes Zoster). Humans are the only source of infection for chicken pox and shingles. Person-to-person transmission occurs by direct contact with vesicular fluid from patients with either condition. Chicken pox may additionally be transmitted by airborne spread from respiratory tract secretions. There is a risk of infection up to 21 days after contact.Chicken pox is a highly  contagious  viral illness  usually  occurring in epidemics. It is generally a benign, self-limiting disease in immuno- competent  children but  tends  to be  more  severe in  adolescents  and adults and also in immunosuppressed patients e.g. patients on steroids. Complications include bacterial super-infection of skin lesions, pneumonia, central nervous system involvement (acute cerebellar ataxia, encephalitis), thrombocytopenia, and other rare complications such as glomerulonephritis, arthritis, and hepatitis.Exposure to the virus during the second 20 weeks of pregnancy can result in congenital varicella syndrome characterised by skin scarring, abnormalities of limbs, brain, eyes and low birth weight.

Chronic BronchitisThis is chronic inflammation of the bronchial mucosa due to irritants such as tobacco smoke. It occurs after the age of 40 years and is part of the syndrome of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There is progressive worsening with age, eventually resulting in chronic respiratory failure. It is aggravated by recurrent viral and bacterial infections.Oxygen therapy in these patients must be given with caution to prevent carbon dioxide retention due to depression of respiration. High flow rates remove the central hypoxic drive that maintains respiratory effort and can be harmful.CAUSES • Cigarette smoking • Industrial dust • Chemical irritants • Inhaled smoke from use of biomass fuels (eg. charcoal, wood) SYMPTOMSShortness of breath, particularly on exertionWheezeFeverCough with production of sputum for most of the yearInfective exacerbation associated with increased quantity of thick purulent sputumSIGNSMay be noneBarrel chestPursed lip breathingClubbingCyanosisIncreased respiratory rateUse of assessory muscles i.e. neck and/or abdominal muscles, for breathingHyperresonance on percussion and loss of cardiac dullnessWheeze or rhonchiReduced Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR)INVESTIGATIONSFBCSpirometry, shows reduced lung volumes, particularly FEV1 which is not reversed post-bronchodilator administrationChest X-raySputum culture and gram stainTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo minimise or stop coughTo prevent or minimise wheeze and shortness of breathTo reduce quantity of sputum producedTo prevent infective exacerbationsNon-pharmacological treatmentSmoking cessationPhysical exerciseGood nutritionUse of face mask in high risk occupationsPharmacological treatmentA.

11. Chronic HepatitisThis refers to chronic inflammation of the liver of more than 6 months duration, with persistently elevated liver function tests. Chronic hepatitis can progress to liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy and hepatocellular carcinoma.Immunisation against Hepatitis B is now available for children under the Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI). Adults in endemic areas including Ghana should be immunised against Hepatitis B infection after initial assessment of their immunological status regarding previous exposure to the virus.Long-term monitoring for disease activity and hepatocellular carcinoma screening with six-monthly Hepatitis B viral DNA quantification, LFTs, abdominal ultrasound and alpha fetoprotein is mandatory for patients with chronic hepatitis B.

CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) refers to kidney damage of  more than 3 months duration. The early stage of CKD is usually asymptomatic but can be detected through laboratory tests of serum creatinine and estimation of Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), measurement of urine albumin creatinine ratio and screening of individuals at increased risk such as those with hypertension, diabetes mellitus or a past history of glomerulonephritis. CKD may manifest either as urine abnormalities (e.g. persistent microalbuminuria, proteinuria, haematuria), blood abnormalities (e.g. elevated urea and creatinine and estimated GFR < 90 ml/minute/1.73 m2) and structural kidney changes on ultrasonography or all stages of CKD, patients should be encouraged to cease smoking, reduce weight if obese, check lipids and treat, and avoid NSAIDs and other nephrotoxic drugs.

Common ColdThis is a self-limiting infection of the upper respiratory tract, particularly the nasopharyngeal mucosa and sinuses. It is  contagious and spread by airborne droplets, as well as from hands and contact   with contaminated surfaces. The symptoms resolve without antibiotic treatment, usually within a week. If the 'cold' lasts longer than a week and there is persistent fever and cough, a diagnosis of influenza may be considered. With influenza, fever, systemic symptoms and prostration are more pronounced. Secondary bacterial infection may be associated with purulent phlegm or offensive nasal discharge and fever.Occasionally, the common cold is complicated by otitis media and pharyngotonsillitis, particularly in children, in which case one should refer to the appropriate sections for treatment.   CAUSES    • Rhinoviruses    • Corona viruses     • Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) SYMPTOMS • Runny nose (rhinorrhea) • Sneezing • Nasal congestion • Mild fever • Headaches • Sore throat • Muscle aches • Cough • Fatigue • Malaise      SIGNS Low grade feverNasal dischargeNasal mucosa reddening Watering of eyesINVESTIGATIONSNo investigations requiredTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo relieve symptomsResolution of infection in the shortest possible timeNon-pharmacological treatmentRestEncourage adequate fluid intakeGargle lukewarm salt solutionSteam inhalationPharmacological treatmentA.

Congenital malformation of the heart, commonly referred to as "Hole-in-Heart", is quite a common malformation with an incidence of   8 out of 1000 live births. There are two main groups of congenital heart disease namely, acyanotic and cyanotic. The acyanotic types include ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus  as well as aortic stenosis, pulmonary stenosis and coarctation of the aorta. The cyanotic types are associated with a mixing of deoxygenated blood with oxygenated blood and include Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA).Early recognition of the specific type and appropriate medical or surgical intervention is important in improving the quality of life and reducing morbidity from complications.CAUSES • Idiopathic • Genetic (higher risk with increasing maternal age)•      Maternal infections due to viruses in early pregnancy, notably rubella • Maternal diabetes • Alcohol, smoking , and use of drugs during early pregnancy • Exposure to X-rays and other radiation during early pregnancy • Prematurity • Multiple pregnancySYMPTOMSAcyanotic • Easy fatiguability • Breathlessness • Poor feeding/Interruption of sucking in babies during feeding • Poor growth • Cold sweat on forehead • Puffy eyelids, swollen feet (however, these are uncommon in infants) • Distended abdomen • Exertion may lead to chest pains, syncope or sudden deathCyanotic • All symptoms of acyanotic heart disease, plus the following: • Blue tongue and fingernails (cyanosis) at birth or becoming worse with exertion in older children • Squatting several times during play in toddlersSIGNSAcyanotic • Signs of heart failure for moderate to severe lesions:•  Cold sweaty skin•  Puffy eyelids•  Distended neck veins and ankle oedema (in older children)•  Tachycardia•  Tachypnoea•  Weak thready pulse•  Cardiomegaly•  Gallop rhythm•  Crepitations, rhonchi•  Hepatomegaly • Heart murmur (not always present)Cyanotic • Signs of heart failure as above, plus • Finger clubbing • Cyanosis (low peripheral oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry) • Heart murmur • Hypercyanotic attack i.e. respiratory distress with deepening cyanosis, loss of consciousness and convulsions INVESTIGATIONS • FBC • Chest X-ray • ECG • EchocardiographyTREATMENTTreatment objectives • Early recognition of the problem • Prompt treatment of heart failure • Early surgical correction if indicated • Prevention of endocarditisNon-pharmacological treatment • Ensure good nutrition, good oral and dental hygiene • Avoid excessive physical exertion (notify parents and teachers)Pharmacological treatmentA.

In general, constipation refers to bowel movements that are infrequent or stools that are difficult to pass. There is great individual variation in normal bowel habits; therefore emphasis should be laid on changes in the bowel habit.Diarrhoea alternating with constipation may indicate a large bowel cancer especially in those aged 40 years and above. In children and the elderly, this may indicate chronic constipation with spurious diarrhoea.The habitual use of laxatives is very common in the community. This practice must be discouraged to avoid hypokalaemia and its consequences.CAUSESMedical•  Diet deficient in roughage•  Ignoring the urge to defaecate e.g. due to immobility•  Hypothyroidism•  Irritable bowel syndrome•  Hypercalcaemia•  Drugs e.g. atropine, codeine, morphine, tricyclic antidepressants, disopyramide•  Lazy bowel from chronic laxative use including 'herbal' preparations•  Lack of exercise•  Dehydration and starvation (particularly in children)Surgical•  Gastrointestinal obstruction•  Anal fissure and other painful perianal lesions•  Carcinoma of the rectum and sigmoid colon•  Foreign body in the gut•  Pelvic mass e.g. fibroid, foetus•  Aganglionic and acquired megacolon•  Pseudo-bowel obstruction (Ogilvie syndrome) following immobility from any causeSYMPTOMS•  Inability to move bowels•  Passing hard stools•  Infrequent passing of stools•  Straining to pass stools•  Feeling of incomplete evacuation of bowel•  Inability to pass flatus, colicky abdominal pain with or without vomitingSIGNS•  Frequent high pitched bowel sounds - suspect mechanical bowel obstruction•  Absent bowel sounds - suspect paralytic ileus•  Signs of peritonitis (generalised tenderness, guarding and rebound tenderness, refer appropriate section) -'suspect gangrenous bowelINVESTIGATIONS•  Digital rectal examination (must be carried out in all patients with suspected diagnosis of constipation)•  Stool for occult blood•  Plain abdominal X-ray (erect and supine)•  Proctoscopy/proctosigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy (must not be done if acute intestinal obstruction is suspected)TREATMENTTreatment objectives•  To identify possible cause of constipation•  To relieve constipationNon-pharmacological treatment•  Adherence to regular exercise•  High fibre diet•  Adequate fluid intake (minimum of 3.2L of water per day if no contraindications exist)Pharmacological treatmentA.

CORONOVIRUS DISEASE(COVID-19)Brief HistoryOn 31st December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. On 7th January 2020, the causative pathogen was identified as a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). On 12th February 2020, the novel coronavirus was named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The associated disease is now referred to as Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19), and was declared a pandemic by WHO on 11th March 2020.  There is limited knowledge about the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, regarding person-to-person spread, severity of resulting infections as well as treatment. New information about this virus keeps emerging, hence the need to keep up with current information to inform important decisions.  The first two cases of COVID-19 in Ghana were confirmed on 12th March 2020. This called for immediate intensive actions towards the containment of the disease across the country. Preventive measures including effective hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene as well as other Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) practices like social distancing, the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) were instituted at all treatment centres and in the community.  As part of efforts to mitigate the pandemic, a multi-disciplinary panel of experts was convened to develop evidence-based country-specific guidelines.  This provisional guideline provides recommendations for the management of patients with COVID-19. It is intended to ensure the best possible chances of survival through optimized supportive care for all patients. Due to the novel nature of this virus, this provisional guideline is also intended to serve as a basis for research into treatments that are showing promise. According to the WHO, the United States (US) Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the US Food and Drug Administration (US-FDA), there are currently (as at the time of developing this guideline) no vaccines that have proven to be effective for the prevention of COVID-19. Additionally, there is insufficient clinical trial evidence globally to support the efficacy and/or safe use of any medicines or blood products (e.g. convalescent plasma) in the prevention (including pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis) or treatment of COVID-19.  There are currently a number of ongoing clinical trials which may warrant review of this provisional guideline on a periodic basis. This guideline is therefore a living document and will continue to be updated in response to emerging evidence.  The general public must avoid statements that stigmatize people with or are suspected to have COVID-19 and any of their contacts as this potentially could prevent or delay reporting.    PREAMBLECorona Virus Disease (COVID-19) is a newly identified Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) caused by a novel corona virus named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that was first reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on 31st December 2019. The disease has spread rapidly among human populations on all continents around the world.since it was first identified. It was initially declared by WHO as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30th January, 2020 and subsequently declared a pandemic on 11th March, 2020.  Although the virus is widely believed to have originated from animals, there is insufficient scientific evidence to identify the specific animal reservoir or the original mode of transmission of the disease to humans. The spread of the disease in humans, however, is currently known to be from person to person, mainly through droplets arising from people sneezing, coughing, speaking or exhaling, which deposit on surfaces. The virus may be transferred from contaminated surfaces to mucosal surfaces (eyes, nose, mouth), via the hands. Aerosol transmission is also possible when people have prolonged exposure to high concentrations of droplets in relatively closed spaces.    The incubation period for COVID-19 (i.e. the time between exposure to the virus and onset of symptoms) is currently estimated to be between 2 and 14 days. Persons infected by this virus may either exhibit no symptoms, or experience an illness which may range from mild to severe. However, asymptomatic and symptomatic persons are equally capable of transmitting the infection.  The experience from observation of patients presenting to health centres around the world suggests that, over 80% of symptomatic individuals with COVID-19 develop mild or uncomplicated illness, and approximately 14% develop severe disease requiring hospitalization and oxygen support, while 5% may have very severe illness requiring admission to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with ventilators for care.  The global evidence also suggests that, whereas symptomatic individuals may initially have mild symptoms and physical signs, there may be clinical deterioration during the second week of illness.    Risk factors for severe illness and higher case fatality include old age and presence of chronic underlying medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension and immunosuppression. The clinical course of COVID-19 in pregnant patients from recent studies is similar to that for non-pregnant individuals of the same age. The symptoms in children are often relatively mild.  Complications of the disease include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) leading to acute respiratory failure, secondary bacterial and other microbial infection, septic shock, cardiac injury, cardiac arrhythmia, liver failure, acute kidney injury, metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction or multi-organ failure. Suspected persons should be held in quarantine for testing. If confirmed, patients should be transferred, by special arrangement with the National Ambulance Service and the COVID-19 case management teams (call emergency phone number 112 on all networks), to designated treatment centres with effective isolation and disease control capacity. Confirmed cases can be treated with multiple patients in the same isolation room. Patients who are severely or critically ill should be admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) as early as possible.  There are currently (as at the time of developing this guideline) no well researched and approved vaccines, medicines or blood-products (e.g. convalescent plasma) specifically for the prevention and treatment of patients with COVID-19. At present clinical management includes infection prevention and control (IPC) measures and supportive care. A number of medicines which were tried in previous outbreaks of coronavirus infections, as well as in the current COVID19 outbreak, together with some investigational drugs are presently being studied at different research and treatment centres all over the world for use as preventive and/or treatment options. In the absence of proven medicines for prevention and treatment of persons with COVID-19, keeping suspected cases in quarantine while awaiting test results, isolation of confirmed cases and tracing of contacts of confirmed cases for early detection of the disease are therefore paramount in preventing the spread of the disease.  Symptomatic treatment of COVID-19 patients should be done in line with standard treatments as provided in the 7th edition of the Standard Treatment Guidelines (STG). (Standard Treatment Guidelines, Ministry of Health, Seventh Edition, 2017).  All treatments opted for from this guideline for patients with COVID-19 must be based on the clinical judgement of a multi-disciplinary COVID-19 case management team. Any treatments opted for must be fully documented and submitted to the appropriate authorities through the District Health Information Management System-2 (DHIMS2) platform.  Furthermore, all adverse drug reactions (ADRs) must be reported to the Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) by completing the appropriate FDA ADR Form and submitting it directly to the FDA or through the institutional contact person (Details provided below under section for ‘Relevant Contacts’). CAUSESSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)SYMPTOMSAdults May be asymptomatic Fever Cough (commonly dry but may be productive)Fatigue Myalgia Sore throat Shortness of breath or difficulty in breathing Nasal congestion Nasal discharge   Loss or reduced sense of smell (anosmia or hyposmia) Anorexia Diarrhoea Children Fever Cough Nasal congestion Rhinorrhea (runny nose)   SIGNSFever (body temperature ≥ 37.5oC) Tachypnea Tachycardia Cyanosis Flaring of nostrils Use of accessory muscles of respiration (plus intercostal in-drawing etc.) Restricted chest wall movement (unilateral or bilateral) Signs of consolidation on chest examination Drowsiness Restlessness or confusion Low blood oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter (SPO2 < 93%)  Clinical Presentations of COVID-19 according to severity Mild Patients with mild COVID-19 illness, may have non-specific symptoms such as fever, fatigue, cough (with or without sputum production), anorexia, malaise, muscle pain, sore throat, dyspnoea, nasal congestion, or headache. Rarely, patients may also present with GI symptoms like diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.   The elderly and immunosuppressed may present with atypical symptoms. Symptoms due to physiologic adaptations of pregnancy or adverse pregnancy events such  as dyspnoea, fever, GI-symptoms or fatigue may overlap with COVID-19 symptoms.  Pneumonia    Adult with pneumonia but no signs of severe pneumonia and no need for supplemental oxygen.  Child with non-severe pneumonia who has cough or difficulty breathing and fast breathing: fast breathing (in breaths/min): < 2 months: ≥ 60; 2–11 months: ≥ 50; 1–5 years: ≥ 40, and no signs of severe pneumonia.Severe pneumoniaAdolescent or adult: fever or suspected respiratory infection, plus one of:  respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min; severe respiratory distress; or SpO2 ≤ 93% on room air  Child with cough or difficulty in breathing, plus at least one of the following:  central cyanosis or SpO2 < 90%; severe respiratory distress (e.g. grunting, flaring alae nasi, very severe chest indrawing); clinical signs of pneumonia with a general danger sign such as inability to breastfeed or drink, lethargy or unconsciousness, or convulsions. Other signs of pneumonia may be present such as intercostal in-drawing, fast breathing (in breaths/min): < 2 months: ≥ 60; 2–11 months: ≥ 50; 1–5 years: ≥ 40.  Note: While the diagnosis is made on clinical grounds, chest imaging is necessary to exclude some pulmonary complications or changes suggestive of ARDS. Acute respiratory distress syndromeOnset: within 1 week of a known clinical insult or new or worsening respiratory symptoms.  Chest imaging (radiograph, CT scan, or lung ultrasound): diffuse bilateral opacities, not fully explained by volume overload, lobar or lung collapse, or nodules.  Origin of pulmonary infiltrates: pulmonary oedema not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload. May needobjective assessment (e.g. echocardiography) to exclude hydrostatic cause of infiltrates/oedema if no obvious cardiovascular risk factor present.  Oxygenation impairment in adults: Mild ARDS: 200 mmHg < PaO2/FiO2a ≤ 300 mmHg (with PEEP or CPAP ≥ 5 cm H2O, or non-ventilated) Moderate ARDS: 100 mmHg < PaO2/FiO2 < 200 mmHg (with PEEP ≥ 5 cm H2O, or non-ventilated)  Severe ARDS: PaO2/FiO2 < 100 mmHg (with PEEP ≥ 5 cm H2O, or non-ventilated)  When PaO2 is not available, SpO2/FiO2 ≤ 315 suggests ARDS (including in non-ventilated patients). Oxygenation impairment in children:Note: OI = Oxygenation Index, OSI = Oxygenation Index using SpO2. Use PaO2-based metric when available. If PaO2 not available, wean FiO2 to maintain SpO2 ≤ 97% to calculate OSI or SpO2/FiO2 ratio    On NIV (BiPAP or CPAP) ≥ 5 cm H2O via full face mask: PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 300 mmHg or SpO2/FiO2 ≤ 264   Mild ARDS (Non-invasive mechanical ventilation): 4 ≤ OI < 8 or 5 ≤ OSI < 7.5 Moderate ARDS (Non-invasive mechanical ventilation): 8 ≤ OI < 16 or 7.5 ≤ OSI < 12.3   •  Severe ARDS (on invasive mechanical ventilation): OI ≥ SepsisAdults: life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to suspected or proven infection.b Signs of organ dysfunction include: altered mental status, difficult or fast breathing, low oxygen saturation (< 93%), reduced urine output, fast heart rate, weak pulse, cold extremities or low blood pressure, skin mottling, or laboratory evidence of coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, acidosis, high lactate or hyperbilirubinaemia. Children: suspected or proven infection and 2 or more agebased systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, of which one must be abnormal temperature or white blood cell count.   Septic shockAdults: persisting hypotension despite volume resuscitation; requiring vasopressors to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg; serum lactate level > 2 mmol/L.  Children: any hypotension (SBP < 5th centile or > 2 SD below normal for age) or two or three of the following: altered mental state; tachycardia or bradycardia (HR < 90 bpm or > 160 bpm in infants and HR < 70 bpm or > 150 bpm in children); prolonged capillary refill (> 2 sec) or feeble pulse; tachypnea; mottled or cool skin or petechial or purpuric rash; increased lactate; oliguria; hyperthermia or hypothermia.     If altitude is higher than 1000 m, then correction factor should be calculated as follows: PaO2/FiO2 x barometric pressure/760. The SOFA score ranges from 0 to 24 and includes points related to six organ systems: respiratory (hypoxemia defined by low PaO2/FiO2); coagulation (low platelets); liver (high bilirubin); cardiovascular (hypotension); central nervous system (low level of consciousness defined by Glasgow Coma Scale); and renal (low urine output or high creatinine). Sepsis is defined by an increase in the sepsis-related SOFA score of ≥ 2 points. Assume the baseline score is 0 if data are not available.

This condition results from high levels of cortisol in the blood and is associated with various changes in the body including the development of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and osteoporosis. The prolonged use or abuse (especially by women for cosmetic reasons) of oral or topical corticosteroids such as prednisolone, dexamethasone, hydrocortisone or cortisone, or preparations containing any of these drugs, is also a cause.CAUSESPituitary tumourAdrenal tumourProlonged and excessive intake (for asthma, nephrotic syndrome etc.) or abuse of corticosteroidsSYMPTOMSWeight gainExcess body hair and acne (pimples)Easy bruising of skinStretch marks (reddish or purplish)Menstrual irregularity and sub-fertilityWeakness of the thigh musclesLightening of the skinSIGNSRounded or 'moon' faceProminent supraclavicular fat padsTruncal obesityExcess facial and body hairAcneStriae (reddish or purplish stretch marks)Thin skinEasy bruising and bleeding into the skin after venepunctureHypertensionInability to rise from the squatting positionINVESTIGATIONSPlasma cortisol (commonly elevated in pituitary and adrenal tumours, but low in corticosteroid use or abuse)Blood electrolytes (may show low potassium)Blood glucose (commonly elevated)Abdominal ultrasound scan (may show an adrenal tumour)CT scan (may show evidence of a pituitary or adrenal tumour)TREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo normalise plasma level of cortisolTo correct electrolyte imbalanceTo correct plasma glucoseTo correct blood pressureTo prevent complications of excess plasma cortisolNon-pharmacological treatmentPituitary or adrenal surgery where tumours in the respective glands have been diagnosedPharmacological treatmentTreatment is dependent on the cause and requires specialized investigations.

Dental caries is a tooth surface cavity caused by acid demineralization of tooth hard tissue. It occurs as a result bacterial conversion of refined carbohydrates to acids, which in prolonged contact with tooth surface leads to the demineralisation. This process is entirely preventable but can progress to severe decay and tooth loss or complicated by infection.CAUSESAcid demineralisation of hard tooth surfaceSYMPTOMSUsually asymptomaticToothache precipitated by hot, cold or sweet foods or drinksPain may be intermittent or severe, sharp and constant if the nerve endings are exposedSIGNSA hole or black spot may be visible on any surface of a toothTenderness on percussion of the affected toothTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo relieve painTo arrest process by excavation and filling of cavitiesTo educate on good dental habitsTo prevent complicationsNon-pharmacological treatmentRegular mouth rinse after refined carbohydrate intakeBrushing of teeth before bedtimePharmacological treatmentA.

Depression is a mood disorder, which may occur in all age groups, although the symptoms may differ in children. It is a relatively common condition and has a tendency to recur. Some affected persons may turn out to have bipolar disorder, in which case, episodes of mania occur.Clinically significant depression, also called major depression, is twice as common in women as in men. Many affected individuals seek help from spiritual and traditional healers. For a good proportion of those who go to hospitals, their condition is not recognised.Depression is a significant cause of morbidity all over the world and most people who attempt or successfully complete suicide have depression. One should not dismiss or take for granted statements made by patients such as "I want to die",  "life is not worth living", or "I am    fed up with life". All cases of attempted suicide should be referred to a psychiatrist after initial management of the presenting complication e.g. self-inflicted injuries or poisoning.Recurrent depression or unipolar depression is treated differently (with antidepressants) from bipolar depression, which responds more to mood stabilizers.The diagnostic criteria for major depression relies on the presence of at least five (5) of the symptoms listed in the section on symptoms below, experienced every day for at least two weeks.In the treatment of depression, maximum tolerable doses of antidepressant medications must be given for at least 6 weeks before deciding a particular medication is not effective.After an episode of depression, treatment must be continued for at least 6 months, as there is a high risk of relapse within this period.Antidepressants must be stopped immediately if a manic swing occurs. Patients with suicidal tendencies must be admitted and kept under close observation.CAUSESGeneticFamilialEnvironmentalPsychosocial factorsEndocrine disorders e.g. hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndromeSYMPTOMSDepressed mood, often reported as feeling 'out of sorts'Loss of interest or lack of pleasure in things previously of interestSignificant weight loss or weight gainInsomnia or sleeping too muchPsychomotor agitation or retardationFatigue or loss of energyFeelings of worthlessness or excessive guiltImpaired thinkingPoor concentration;indecisiveness;worrying excessivelyMultiple bodily complaintsSuicidal ideas or thoughts of deathHallucinations or delusions of morbid themes in severe casesIn childrenTruancy or refusal to go to schoolPoor school performanceBedwetting in a previously 'dry' childOdd behaviour, aggression or defianceIrritabilityAppetite changesSome of the 'adult' symptoms listed aboveSIGNSDepressed moodEvidence of weight loss or weight gainAgitation or retardationHallucinationsINVESTIGATIONSFBCBUE and CreatinineFBSThyroid function and cortisol levels if indicatedAdminister a standardized scale of depression such as the PHQ (patient health questionnaire 9 item scale)TREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo reduce symptomsTo prevent disruption to normal life at home, work or schoolTo prevent suicideNon-pharmacological treatmentCounsellingPsychotherapy, specifically Cognitive Behaviour TherapyElectroconvulsive therapyPharmacological treatment 1st Line Treatment Evidence Rating: [A]Fluoxetine, oral,ADULTS20 mg once daily for 2-4 weeks,ThenIncrease if necessary to max. of 80 mgCHILDREN8-18 years; 10 mg once daily for 1-2 weeksThenIncrease if necessary to max. 20 mg once daily.< 8 years;  not recommendedNote 10-4Use with caution in children with epilepsy.

Diabetes mellitus is characterised by persistently elevated blood glucose levels. If left untreated or improperly treated for long periods this will result in widespread blood vessel damage and complications relating to the eyes, kidneys, heart, brain and nerves. There is an increased risk of lower limb amputations, poor fertility and pregnancy outcomes with improper glucose control.Although children and adolescents often present with acute symptoms, many adults with diabetes are asymptomatic. It is therefore necessary to exclude diabetes in all persons, especially adults, attending health facilities for routine medical examinations, first out-patient review, ante-natal care, elective and emergency admissions or undergoing surgical procedures.The non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions in diabetes management are usually life-long.Individuals found to have venous or capillary plasma glucose levels in the pre-diabetes or diabetes ranges, as shown in the table below, will need further assessment to confirm the diagnosis.Fasting plasma glucose2-hr post prandial plasma glucoseHbA1cStatus< 5.6 mmol/L< 7.8 mmol/L<5.7%Normal< 5.6 mmol/L7.8 - 11.1 mmol/L5.7 - 6.4 %IGT (Pre-diabetes)5.7-6.9 mmol/L< 7.8 mmol/L5.7 - 6.4 %IFG (Pre-diabetes)>7.0 mmol/L>11.1 mmol/L>6.5 %Diabetes    HbA1c - Glycated Haemoglobin IGT - Impaired Glucose Tolerance IFG - Impaired Fasting GlycaemiaFour forms of diabetes are encountered in practice:Type 1 diabetesType 2 diabetesGestational diabetes (See section on 'Diabetes in Pregnancy')Secondary diabetes (related to medication use, endocrine or pancreatic disease etc.)CAUSESAutoimmune disorder (Type 1 diabetes)Idiopathic (Type 1 diabetes)Genetic factors causing a defect in the action or secretion of insulin (Type 2 diabetes)Environmental factors e.g. excessive calorie intake and lack of physical activity (Type 2 diabetes)Pregnancy (Gestational diabetes)Secondary diabetes:Medication e.g. corticosteroid use or abusePancreatic disease or pancreatectomyEndocrine disorders e.g. Cushing's syndrome, acromegaly etc.SYMPTOMSUsually none in many adultsPolyuria and nocturiaPolydipsiaUnexplained weight lossBlurred visionRecurrent boilsRecurrent pruritus vulvaeErectile dysfunctionSymptoms related to chronic complications (e.g. 'pins and needles' sensation or numbness in the hands or feet, foot gangrene, poor vision etc.)Delivery of large babies (> 4 kg)SIGNSUsually none in most patientsLack of sensation in the feet or handsFoot gangrenePedal oedemaImpaired visual acuityCataractRetinal changes on fundoscopyINVESTIGATIONSNewly diagnosed patientFasting or random blood glucoseOral glucose tolerance test (if required to confirm diagnosis)Blood urea, electrolytes and creatinineFasting blood lipid profile (adults)Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)FBCECG (adults)UrinalysisUrine ketones (with high initial glucose levels)During routine follow upsBlood glucoseRecorded results of regular self-monitoring of fasting and ran- dom tests at home by the patient using a glucose meterPeriodic fasting or random tests during clinic reviewsGlycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (at least twice a year)Blood lipid tests (annually, but more frequently if levels abnormal or on lipid lowering medication)Blood urea, electrolytes and creatinine (annually, but more frequently if levels abnormal)Urine microalbumin (annually)TREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo relieve symptomsTo prevent acute hyperglycaemic complications (i.e. ketoacidosis and the hyperosmolar state)To prevent treatment-related hypoglycaemiaTo achieve and maintain appropriate glycaemic targetsFasting blood glucose between 4-7 mmol/L (less intensive gly- caemic targets in elderly patients)2-hour post-meal blood glucose between 5-9 mmol/L (less in- tensive glycaemic targetsin elderly patients)Glycated haemoglobin 7 % or less (less intensive glycaemic tar- gets in elderly patients)To ensure weight reduction in overweight and obese individualsTo prevent chronic complications of diabetes by maintainingThe glycaemic targets noted aboveBlood pressure less than 130/80 mmHgLDL-cholesterol less than 2.5 mmol/LNon-pharmacological treatmentBox 12-1: Therapeutic lifestyle modificationDiet:Complex carbohydrates (e.g. kenkey, yam, plantain etc.) are preferredAvoid refined sugars as in soft drinks, or adding sugar to beverages.

Type 1 diabetes patients and Type 2 patients on insulin monotherapyNote 12-2Insulin dose requirements vary from patient to patient irrespective of age and body weight.The total daily insulin requirement for most adults and pre-pubertal children  is about 0.6-0.8 units/kg, which should be given in divided doses. However, it  is prudent to begin with lower doses and build this up with time to prevent hypoglycaemia.Insulin requirements increase during infections, puberty, periods of stress, accidental or surgical trauma, pregnancy etc.The usual route for insulin injections for outpatient diabetes treatment is sub-cutaneous, administered 30 minutes before a meal for regular/soluble insulin, premix insulin, or NPH insulin and immediately before the meal for rapid acting analogue insulins (e.g. aspart, lispro) according to the following regimens:Twice daily pre-mixed insulin (soluble + intermediate acting insulin) before breakfast and supper (preferred)OrTwice daily injections of Soluble PLUS NPH 30 minutes before breakfast and Soluble PLUS NPH 30 minutes before supper.

DIABETES MELLITUS IN PREGNANCY
Diabetes Mellitus in pregnancy includes individuals known to be diabetic prior to pregnancy and those who develop impaired glucose tolerance during pregnancy. Gestational diabetes refers to impaired glucose tolerance of any degree that develops or is first recognized during the current pregnancy, irrespective of whether it resolves after delivery or not. Diabetes is associated with poor health outcomes for a mother and her baby if not properly managed. Many patients with gestational diabetes are asymptomatic making screening for all pregnant women mandatory to identify those at risk. A fasting blood glucose test must be done on all pregnant women at booking and also at 28-32 weeks (See section on 'Antenatal Care'). The management of diabetes mellitus in pregnancy and the puerperium involves close monitoring of the woman by a multidisciplinary approach comprising a team of obstetricians, midwives, nurses, dieticians, physicians, anaesthetists and paediatricians. Labour (induced or spontaneous) and Caesarean section are best supervised in hospital under specialist care.
Anti-diabetic treatment requirements reduce dramatically after delivery hence, post delivery treatment doses must be tailored to each individual patient's needs.
The newborn baby of a diabetic mother needs special care and is best managed by a paediatrician/ neonatologist. Hypoglycaemia in the baby in the first few hours of birth is a major problem. It can be prevented by initiating early (within 1 hour) breastfeeding. They may also require management for respiratory distress syndrome, electrolyte imbalances (e.g. hypercalcaemia, hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia) and hyperbilirubinaemia.
All diabetic mothers must be counselled on family planning.
CAUSES

Pre-existing Type 1 diabetes mellitus
Pre-existing Type 2 diabetes mellitus
Gestational diabetes mellitus

SYMPTOMS

Usually asymptomatic
Previous history of large babies ( > 4 kg)
Previous poor obstetric history (foetal deaths, miscarriages )
Other features of diabetes (See section on 'Diabetes Mellitus')

SIGNS

Foetus larger than gestational age (as assessed by serial symphysio- fundal height or by ultrasound scan)
Foetus smaller than gestational age (IUGR)
Presence of polyhydramnios
Other signs of diabetic complications (See section on 'Diabetes

Mellitus')
INVESTIGATIONS

All basic Antenatal Care Investigations
Ultrasound scan
Foetal anomaly scan at 16-22 weeks
Serial scans for growth assessment in third trimester
Urine culture and sensitivity (monthly)
High vaginal swab for candidiasis
Blood urea, electrolytes and creatinine
Blood glucose profile (Fasting blood glucose and 2-hour post- prandial blood glucose monthly in the lab; more frequently by self- monitoring)


 Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C) every 6-8 weeks

TREATMENT
Treatment objectives

To achieve normal blood glucose and glycated haemoglobin levels throughout pregnancy, labour, delivery and puerperium
To prevent maternal and foetal complications
To prevent neonatal morbidity and mortality
To detect and manage other associated complications e.g. pre- eclampsia
Non-pharmacological treatment
General measures (dietary modification, exercise, patient counselling and education, blood glucose monitoring must be discussed with a dietician, obstetrician or midwife, respectively)
Frequent ANC visits are required
Delivery
by 40 weeks gestation: in well controlled patients with no com- plications
by 38 weeks gestation; in Insulin treated patients and those with complications
Caesarean section; for patients with either of the following;
severe pre-eclampsia, previous caesarean section,
advanced maternal age, malpresentation or foetal
macrosomia
If elective preterm delivery is necessary, mature the foetal lungs with corticosteroids under specialist care
Puerperium
Close blood glucose monitoring in the first 48 hours after delivery

Pharmacological treatment




Box 13-4: Notes on glycaemic control of diabetes in pregnancy




Before planned pregnancy
0ptimise glycaemic control in known diabetics before pregnancy. During pregnancy
If diet alone cannot control the blood glucose level consider hypoglycaemic agents: metformin, glibenclamide and insulin
� Diabetic patients on oral medication who become pregnant can be main- tained on their oral medication if sugar control is satisfactory (fasting glu- cose levels between 4-6 mmol/L and 2-hour postprandial glucose between 4-7 mmol/L; glycated Hb [HbA1c] less than 6.5%)
Indications for oral antidiabetic agents use:
� Gestational Diabetics who fail to achieve satisfactory control with diet and exercise alone (FBS > 6.1mmmol/l)
� Poor compliance to insulin e.g. poor administration skills
� Poor glycaemic self monitoring
� Insulin therapy poses financial burden or is not readily available Absolute Indications for Insulin use
� Signifiant diabetic related morbidity exists e.g. nephropathy, retininopathy,
neuropathy
� Persistently high Haemoglobin A1c
� Persistent ketonuria
� Significant obstetric morbidities e.g. foetal macrosomia, polyhydraminios, IUGR
� During antenatal corticosteroid therapy with expected deterioration of gly- caemic control
� Poor glycaemic control with oral antidiabetic agents

Keep fasting glucose levels between 4-6 mmol/L and 2-hour postprandial glucose between 4-7 mmol/L.
This is often achievable on an out-patient basis. However, some patients would need to be admitted to hospital for short periods to ensure good glycaemic control.
Insulin requirements during labour should be given according to a sliding scale (See section on 'Diabetic ketoacidosis' and Sliding scale)
Insulin requirements during caesarean section and other operative procedures (using a sliding scale or Glucose-Potassium-Insulin infusion or GKI) should be discussed with the anaesthetist

Refer to hospital for specialist care. For the convenience of patients shared care between specialist and medical officer may be appropriate.





    
    
    

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a condition associated with high blood glucose (usually > 18 mmol/L), which nonetheless, is unavailable to the body tissues as a source of energy. Fat is therefore broken down as an alternative source of energy, releasing toxic chemicals called ketones as a by-product. Additionally, there is severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalance in DKA, especially low potassium. It is a common cause of death among diabetes patients in Ghana. It often occurs in type 1 diabetes patients but may also occur in type 2 diabetes.In contrast, the Hyperosmolar Non-Ketotic state (HONK) in diabetes occurs primarily in Type 2 patients, and is similar in its clinical presentation to diabetic ketoacidosis in many respects. A major difference, however, is the absence of a significant amount of ketones in the urine (usually trace or 1+) and the presence of severe dehydration. The management of this condition is similar to that of DKA.CAUSESSevere deficiency of insulinInterruption of anti-hyperglycaemic therapy (usually for financial reasons or for alternative treatment)Stress of intercurrent illness (e.g. infection, myocardial infarction,stroke, surgery, complicated pregnancy etc.)SYMPTOMSPolyuriaPolydipsiaNausea, vomitingAbdominal painAlteration in sensorium or collapseSymptoms of infection or other underlying conditionSIGNSDehydration (dry skin, reduced skin turgor or sunken eyes)Deep and fast breathingLow blood pressureFast and weak pulse'Fruity' breath (smell of acetone)Confusion, stupor or unconsciousnessEvidence of infection, recent surgery, stroke etc.INVESTIGATIONSRandom blood glucose (usually >18 mmol/L)Urine glucose (usually >3+)Urine ketones (usually >2+)Blood urea and electrolytes (usually low potassium, however if in renal failure urea and potassium may be high)Blood film for malaria parasitesFull blood count (raised white cell count would suggest bacterial infection)Urine cultureBlood cultureChest X-ray (for pneumonia)Arterial blood gasesElectrocardiogram (to identify hypokalaemia, and in adult patients to exclude acute myocardial infarction as a precipitating factor)TREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo replace the fluid lossesTo replace the electrolyte losses, especially potassiumTo replace deficient insulinTo seek the underlying cause and treat appropriatelyPharmacological treatmentA.

Diarrhoea is defined as the passage of frequent, loose, watery stools 3 or more times a day. Diarrhoea may be accompanied by vomiting.In children, the commonest cause is viral. There is therefore usually no need to prescribe antibiotics. 0ther diseases like malaria, pneumonia, ear infections and urinary tract infections, may be associated with diarrhoea. Fluid loss occurs quickly in this age group because of their size. If not corrected, it may result in dehydration, which can be fatal.A complaint of diarrhoea should be taken seriously. Always ask about the frequency and the texture of the stools. Giving antibiotics in all cases of diarrhoea may worsen or prolong the condition except in special circumstances (See section on 'Causes' below). Enemas and laxatives should not be given to patients with diarrhoea. CAUSESAcute diarrhoea (< 2 weeks)•InfectionsViral: e.g. rotavirus, norovirusBacterial: e.g. Salmonella spp., Shigella, Campylobacter, E. coli, Vibrio choleraeProtozoal: e.g. Entamoeba histolytica (amoebiasis)•Drug-induced: e.g. penicillins Chronic diarrhoea (> 2 weeks)•  Chronic infections: e.g. amoebiasis, tuberculosis, opportunistic infections with HIV•  Functional: e.g. irritable bowel syndrome•  Inflammatory: e.g. ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease•  Malabsorption syndromes: e.g. chronic pancreatitis•  Malignancy: e.g. colon cancer•  Endocrine: e.g. hyperthyroidism, diabetic autonomic neuropathy•  Drug-induced: e.g. laxatives, NSAIDsSYMPTOMS•  Frequent watery stools•  Blood or mucus in the stool•  Presence of fever•  Reduced urine output•  Associated vomitingSIGNSAdults•  Anaemia•  Weight loss•  Anorexia•  Oral lesions e.g. oral ulcers, candidiasis•  Skin lesions e.g. erythema nodosum•  Signs of dehydration (dry mucous membranes, reduction in skin turgor, capillary refill > 2 seconds, tachycardia, postural hypotension)•  Enlarged thyroid•  Abdominal masses•  Rectal mass INVESTIGATIONS•  FBC•  Blood film for malaria parasites•  Stool routine examination•  Stool for culture and sensitivity•  Blood urea and creatinineTREATMENTTreatment objectives•  To prevent dehydration•  To replace lost fluid•  To maintain nutrition by ensuring adequate dietary intake during illness•  To maintain personal hygiene•  To eliminate infecting organisms where appropriateNon-pharmacological treatment•  Keep surroundings clean•  Improve personal hygiene e.g. hand washing after toilet•  Adequate fluid intake - oral and intravenous as necessary (See section on 'Fluid management for children with diarrhoea')•  Maintain adequate nutrition as can be toleratedPharmacological treatmentA.

Refer all patients with chronic diarrhoea to a specialist for further evaluation and management. TREATMENT ALGORITHMFluid management for children with diarrhoeaTreatment Plan A-Nodehydration•  Child can be treated safely at home•  Instruct mother to give home-based fluids like rice water, koko, soup, water, and 0ral Rehydration Salt (ORS).•  Breastfed babies should be given breast milk and ORS•  Give as much as child wants of all the fluids•  Child should continue to feed•  Ask the mother to return to the health facility if the child gets worse, passes more watery stools, vomits repeatedly, becomes very thirsty, eats or drinks poorly or is not better in 2 days•  Instruct mother on how to prevent diarrhoeaORS currently recommended for use in mild to moderate diarrhoea has a reduced sodium and glucose concentration (low osmolarity).How to prepare ORSORS: Dissolve the contents of one sachet of ORS in 600 ml or 1000 mls depending on type of ORS.•  To get 600 ml, use 2 small (300 ml) soft drink bottles or 1 big beer bottle•  To get 1000 ml, use 1L mineral water bottleThe child or adult should drink AS MUCH of it as he/she wants. If the child vomits, the mother should wait about 10 minutes and give it again. Treatment Plan B-mild to moderate dehydrationFor the child with mild-moderate dehydration, use treatment Plan B•  Child to be treated in the health facility•  Give ORS over the first 4 hours as shown in the Table for Plan B•  If child vomits, wait 10 minutes and start again•  Continue with other fluids the child will accept•  Instruct mother to continue breast feeding if child is breastfeeding•  Observe stools passed and record quantity•  Check for signs of worsening dehydration•  If eyes become puffy, it means too much fluid has been given so stop ORS and re-evaluate•  Reassess state of dehydration after 4 hours•  If clinical state has improved with no dehydration - go to plan A•  If there is still mild-moderate dehydration repeat plan B•  If condition is worsening - go to plan C *Use the child's age only when you do not know the weight. The approximate amount of ORS required (in ml) can also be calculated by multiplying the child's weight (in kg) by 75Treatment Plan C-Severe dehydration•  A child with severe dehydration requires urgent treatment with IV fluids in hospital•  If the child can drink, give ORS by mouth while the IV line is beingset up•  Start IV fluids immediately. Give 100 ml/kg Ringer's lactate solution or, if not available, normal saline or cholera replacement fluid (5:4:1), divided as shown in the Table for Plan C below:•  If you cannot give the above treatment and cannot pass a nasogastric tube, refer to a health facility that can do so.•  Reassess the child every 1-2 hours. If hydration status is not improving, give the IV fluid more rapidly than as stated in the Table for Plan B•  Also give ORS (about 5 ml/kg body weight/hour) as soon as the child can drink: usually after 3-4 hours (infants) or 1-2 hours (children)•  Reassess an infant after 6 hours and a child after 3 hours. Classify dehydration. Then choose the appropriate plan (A, B, or C) to continue treatment•  Assess child hourly. If not improving or dehydration is worse, increasedrip rate•  Do not stop the IV fluids until the child has been observed to retain the ORS for at least 1 hour and there is improvement in the clinical condition•  Continue ORS on treatment plan B and continue to observe child until child has no signs of dehydration, then move to Plan A•  Severe diarrhoea may be complicated by marked fluid loss accompanied by loss of potassium (hypokalaemia) or on the other hand, impaired renal function leading to acidosis and elevated blood potassium (hyperkalaemia)•  When the patient is passing adequate amounts of urine, probably indicating good renal function, start potassium containing foods such as coconut water and fresh fruits (e.g. banana)•  If there is clinical and/or laboratory evidence of severe hypokalaemia, potassium should be given by the intravenous route using potassium chloride but only in a hospital. Potassium containing fluids such as half strength Darrow's solution or Ringer's lactate may be added•  If possible, infants and children should continue to breastfeed or eat during the period of diarrhoea. *Repeat once if radial pulse is still very weak or not detectable.





    
    
    

DiphtheriaThe bacteria responsible for this disease produces a toxin that damages human body tissues and organs. It commonly affects the tonsils and sometimes the skin causing ulcers. It is spread mainly by respiratory droplets from person to person, and less commonly through skin contact. Infected patients may recover after initial symptoms and signs or develop severe weakness and die within 6-10 days. Complications may develop in the early phase of the disease or weeks later such as abnormal heartbeat and heart failure, damage to valves of the heart, or respiratoryobstruction leading to death.The disease is now uncommon because of immunisation. However, high immunisation coverage needs to be maintained to keep the disease under control because it has a high mortality rate. Note 5-2All cases of diphtheria should be reported to the District Disease Control Officer CAUSES • Corynebacterium diphtheriaeSYMPTOMS • Sore throat • Loss of appetite • Slight fever • Dysphagia • Difficulty in breathing with or without stridorSIGNS • Greyish white membrane or patch in the throat and on tonsils within 2-3 days of the onset of symptoms.

Dizziness is a nonspecific term that refers  to abnormal sensation   of body orientation or position in space. These include feeling of unsteadiness, light-headedness and vertigo. Patients often find these sensations difficult to describe. Dizziness is almost always associated with other symptoms, therefore a careful history and focused physical examination should be performed in all cases to identify the cause.Like dizziness, "blackouts" is a vague, descriptive term implying either altered consciousness, visual disturbance or a sensation of falling. A careful history, particularly from an eye-witness, is essential.Episodes of transient disturbance of consciousness and falls are common clinical problems. It is usually possible to distinguish between  a fit (a seizure), an episode of fainting and other types of attack from the history given by the patient and the account of an eye witness.CAUSESCardiovascular • Vasovagal - (fainting) • Postural hypotension • Acute haemorrhage • Cardiac arrhythmias • Severe aortic stenosis • Complete heart block with Stokes-Adams attacks • Vertebro-basilar insufficiencyCerebral • Transient Ischaemic Attacks (TIA) • Stroke • EpilepsyOthers • Drug-induced • Severe anaemia • Hypoglycaemia • Middle ear disease • Meniere's disease • Conversion disorder (Hysterical fainting/Hyperventilation)SYMPTOMS • Light-headedness • Loss of consciousness • Sense of motion or spinning of body • Unsteadiness • Nausea • Vomiting • TinnitusSIGNS • Sweating (suggests vasovagal episode/ hypoglycaemia) • Tachycardia or bradycardia (suggest cardiac arrhythmia) • Hypotension • Postural hypotension • Pallor•      Nystagmus, dysdiadochokinesis, ataxia, hypotonia, dysarthria (suggests cerebellar cause) • Focal neurological signs suggests stroke, TIAINVESTIGATIONS • These vary depending on the cause • FBC • Random blood sugar • X-ray of cervical spine • ECGTREATMENTTreatment objectives • To identify and appropriately manage the possible underlying cause(s)Non-pharmacological treatment • Postural hypotension - review medications • Hyperventilation syndrome- breathing control exercise • Counseling • Cervical collar • Moulded cervical pillowsPharmacological treatment • Treat the underlying cause.

Drug resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) must be presumed (suspected) in persons who remain bacteriologically positive (either smear positive, culture positive or Gene Xpert positive) after intensive phase of standard first-line TB treatment with or without clinical improvement. Persons who test rifampicin resistance positive at initial diagnosis with Gene Xpert must also be treated as cases of DR-TB. These persons must be further evaluated using TB culture and Drug Susceptibility Testing (DST) or newer molecular diagnostic tests such as Line Probe Assays (LPA).Persons at high risk of drug resistance are TB patients failing Category I+III or Category II treatment, contacts of confirmed DR-TB patients and TB/HIV co-infected patients not improving on treatment.Persons at medium risk of drug resistance are relapsed TB patients, return after lost-to-follow up and health care workers newly diagnosed with TB. Patients are classified according to the pattern of documented drug resistance profile.The drug regimen for treatment is selected based on the following principles:History of drugs used to treat TB patients, profile of drug resistance in Ghana and/or DST profile of the patientA minimum of four new core medicines that are known to be effectiveKanamycin/Capreomycin an injectable medicine, is the backbone of the four core medicines and should be used in the intensive phaseAn effective fluoroquinolone should be used due to the extensive use of earlier generation fluoroquinolonesMay include a first line drug to which the strain is susceptible.Cross-resistance may occur between drugs of the same group and this is taken into consideration.Drugs are administered daily under strict D0T throughout the injectable and continuation phases.Treatment of Multi Drug Resistant-TB (MDR-TB) and Rifampicin Resistant-TB (RR-TB) patients is prioritised. Treatment duration is 20-24 months and is determined by sputum smear and culture (bacteriological) conversion (Treatment lasts 16-18 months after bacteriological conversion). Progression from initial to continuation phase is dependent on at least four (4) consecutive months of negative sputum cultures.Community-based care is promoted in Ghana over facility-based care except in situations requiring admission for management of complications. The practice of infection prevention and control should be maintained at all times during treatment of these patients.Treatment adherence is critical in the treatment of DR-TB due to limited number of available, effective medicines. Treatment is challenging due to long duration, drug toxicities and side effects. Clinical teams must use a patient-centred care approach and support patients throughout treatment until cured. Psychosocial and economic support is required from treatment supporters, patient families and clinical teams throughout treatment. Early detection and prompt management of drug side effects ensures successful outcomes.

16. Drugs and the LiverDrug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI) can occur following the use of a variety of either prescription or over-the-counter medications. A high index of suspicion is often necessary in establishing the diagnosis. Early recognition of drug toxicity is important to permit withdrawal of the offending drug, assessment of severity and monitoring for acute liver failure. Drug-induced liver injury can be dose-dependent or idiosyncratic.The hallmark for the treatment of DILI is early withdrawal of the offending drug.CAUSESAllopathic drugs (prescription, over-the-counter, anaesthetic agents, e.g. paracetamol, statins, isoniazid, halothane, amiodarone, azathioprine, carbamazepine, phenytoin, nevirapine, ketoconazole, flucloxacillin etc.)Herbal preparationsDietary supplementsSYMPTOMSAsymptomaticRight upper quadrant painNauseaAnorexiaMalaiseLethargyPruritusSIGNSOccasionally noneJaundiceScratch marksBruisingAsterixisAltered mental stateSigns of pre-existing chronic liver diseaseINVESTIGATIONSFBCLFTSBUE and CreatinineSerum glucoseUrinalysisHepatitis screen (A, B, C, E) for exclusionAbdominal ultrasound scanTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo identify and withdraw the offending agentTo report as adverse drug event to Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) promptlyTo assess severity of liver diseaseTo administer antidote where applicable or feasible Non-pharmacological treatment(See section on 'Hepatic Encephalopathy')Pharmacological treatmentA.

Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a common disease although often asymptomatic. The deep veins of the lower limbs are affected most commonly, but thrombosis may affect other sites, including the upper limbs, intracranial and splanchnic veins. Complications include pulmonary thromboembolism, which can be life-threatening. It is therefore essential to have a reliable method for establishing the DVT risk of patients and to take active steps to provide prophylactic treatment as necessary. Common risk factors for DVT include obesity, smoking, prolonged immobility (e.g. bed rest, long haul flights), major surgery e.g. orthopaedic, abdominal and pelvic surgery, pregnancy and the puerperium, after caesarean section, malignancies, inherited blood disorders, oestrogen therapy and medical conditions, e.g. congestive cardiac failure, myocardial infarction, nephrotic syndrome, stroke, systemic lupus erythematosus.In cases of confirmed DVT, treatment with anticoagulants must not be delayed unnecessarily unless there are significant contraindications to their use such as recent intracerebral bleed, severe liver disease, active peptic ulcer, bleeding disorders, and severe hypertension.CAUSES • Stagnation of blood in the vein • Increased viscosity of blood • Inflammation of the blood vessel causing damageSYMPTOMS • Swelling or firmness of affected limb (usually unilateral) • Pain in the affected limb • Mild feverSIGNS • Swelling of affected limb • Differential warmth • Tenderness • Redness • Pitting oedema • Prominent superficial veins

There is ample evidence linking high blood cholesterol levels to Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) events, including myocardial infarction, strokes, and peripheral vascular disease. 0n the other hand, there is also evidence for significant reduction in morbidity and mortality from CVDs by reducing blood cholesterol levels in those at risk (primary prevention) and those who have suffered a CVD event (secondary prevention).The commonly assessed blood lipid parameters are total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. However, the primary target for intervention is the LDL-cholesterol level. As treatment may   be for long periods or lifelong, periodic monitoring of liver and muscle enzymes (transaminases and creatine kinase) and blood glucose are advisable to forestall medication-related side effects.CAUSESHigh dietary intake of saturated fats (animal fat)Lack of physical activityMetabolic syndrome (a combination of several of the following; obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidaemia, gout etc.)Hereditary factorsExcessive alcohol intakeHypothyroidismNephrotic syndromeSYMPTOMSUsually noneAbdominal pain from pancreatitis related to hypertriglyceridaemiaSIGNSUsually noneOccasionallyWhitish ring around the cornea (corneal arcus)Yellowish skin eruptions around the eyes (xanthelasmata)Whitish blood sample (lipaemic blood)INVESTIGATIONSFasting blood lipid profileThyroid function test (if lipid levels very high)Plasma protein (if lipid levels very high, to exclude nephrotic syndrome)Urine protein (if lipid levels very high, to exclude nephrotic syndrome)Treatment objectivesTo reduce the risk of clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular events and related deaths in:Healthy individuals at risk (primary prevention)Individuals who have suffered a CVD event (secondary prevention)To reduce the LDL-C level to the following targets:At least a 50 % LDL-C reduction for primary prevention (in the general population i.e. individuals 2" 21 years of age with an un- treated LDL-C 2" 4.9 mmol/L)30-49 % LDL-C reduction for primary prevention (in individuals  40 to 75 years of age with diabetes with an untreated LDL-C 1.8-4.9 mmol/L)LDL-C < 1.8 mmol/L for secondary prevention (in adults who have previously suffered a heart attack, stroke or peripheral vascular disease)Non-pharmacological treatmentDietary measures - a low calorie, low saturated fat (animal fat), high polyunsaturated fat (plant fat) diet is recommended under the supervision of a dieticianWeight reduction in patients who are overweight or obeseReduction in alcohol consumption, where this is excessiveRegular physical activity or exercise tailored to the individual patientPharmacological treatmentA.

ECLAMPSIA
Eclampsia occurs as a complication of worsening pre-eclampsia. The blood pressure is high with associated proteinuria and convulsion or eclamptic fit, which is similar to an epileptic fit with tonic and clonic phases followed by coma. The fits are often repetitive and of short duration (60-90 seconds).
CAUSES

TREATMENT
Treatment objectives

To protect the patient from injury
To prevent further fits
To lower the blood pressure
To monitor for organ failures (e.g. renal) as well as obstetric complications g. placental abruption and foetal distress
To prevent maternal mortality
To deliver the baby when the mother is stable

Non-pharmacological treatment

Lay patient in the recovery position
Prevent patient from falling
Avoid restricting patient to prevent limb fractures and joint dislocations
Do not put anything in patient's mouth to prevent tongue biting
Maintain the airway by either holding up the chin or if possible, inserting a mechanical airway to hold down the tongue
If postpartum and patient remains unconscious for a long period, consider turning them every hour to prevent sores from developing
Artificial respiration may be required following general anaesthesia

After the fits

Obtain IV access
Catheterise the patient
If no further fits and after patient is stabilized, deliver the foetus by the most appropriate method to ensure safety of both mother and baby
Mode of delivery will depend on the patient's clinical condition, the

status of the foetus and her preference

ECZEMAEczema or dermatitis is an acute or chronic inflammatory reaction in the skin often due to an external (exogenous) or internal (endogenous) factor. Exogenous eczema (contact eczema) includes primary irritant dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis. Endogenous eczema includes atopic eczema, seborrhoiec eczema, discoid eczema, asteatotic eczema, varicose eczema and endogenous hand and soles dermatitis.Contact dermatitis may be an irritant (concentration dependent) or allergic (delayed hypersensitivity) reaction to specific external substance such as metals, rubber, chemicals etc. In contrast to the endogenous types, the skin reaction is confined to the areas directly in contact with the offending substance or allergen.Atopic eczema is a common chronic but self-limiting pruritic skin disorder mainly of childhood but sometimes persists into adult life. The rash usually appears within  the first year of life, mostly between ages   2 and 4 months. In older children the rash characteristically involves   the flexural areas. A familial background of atopy (asthma, hay fever, eosinophilia, allergic rhinitis and similar skin problem) is often present. The condition is characterised by relapses and remissions.Seborrhoiec eczema presents as a scaly, flaking, dry and reddened rash of the scalp, eyebrows, nasolabial folds, perioral, periorbital and periauricular skins. Sometimes it presents as hypopigmented macules.   It may be associated with Pityrosporum ovale infection. Extensive forms are associated with immunosuppressive states, particularly HIV/AIDS and diabetes mellitus.

Epilepsy is a disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), which is characterized by spontaneous recurrent seizures or the tendency to have seizures. Epilepsy is now classified as Generalized (tonic, clonic, absence, atonic or myoclonic) with aura and loss of consciousness or Focal.Traditionally, a single seizure has been regarded as an indication for investigation and assessment, but not for drug treatment unless the circumstances of the seizure necessitate it.Drug treatment should certainly be considered after two seizures, or if the second seizure follows closely from the first. The type of drug used depends on the type of seizure.Drug treatment of epilepsy should be guided by the following general principles. Begin with a single drug at the lowest dosage range and increase dose gradually to the upper limit of dosage range or until side-effects appear, if seizures are not controlled.Subsequently, if seizures still remain uncontrolled, change to a different drug by gradually reducing the dose of the initial agent while simultaneously introducing the new one. This usually takes 3-4 weeks.Try three separate drugs in this fashion if no clinical response is observed, before resorting to drug combinations.Anticonvulsant drug treatment can be totally withdrawn (gradually) in a patient with epilepsy only after a 2-year seizure-free period and after a full evaluation and discussion with the patient.Patients with epilepsy should be advised not to drive a vehicle if  not certified to be seizure-free, swim alone, work at heights, operate machines, cook by open fire alone, nor ingest alcohol excessively.CAUSESIdiopathicSYMPTOMS(See section on 'Seizures')SIGNS(See section on 'Seizures')INVESTIGATIONS(See section on 'Seizures')TREATMENTTreatment objectives(See section on 'Seizures')Non-pharmacological treatment(See section on 'Seizures')Pharmacological treatmentA.

ERECTILE DYSFUNCTIONIt means the persistent inability of a man to achieve an erection, which is adequate in terms of hardness and duration for satisfactory sexual intercourse. So long as a man can achieve a hard enough erection to permit vaginal  penetration,  with a  long  enough "staying  power"  to perform the sexual act till ejaculation is attained, he is judged to be potent. The number of "rounds" per session is irrelevant.The condition may be classified as organic, psychogenic or mixed in terms of aetiology; primary (never been able to attain and/or maintain an erection for satisfactory sexual intercourse) or secondary, where impotence occurs in men who have previously had a satisfactory sexual performance.CAUSESPsychogenicAnxietyDepressionStressMarital conflictOrganicVasculogenic: arterial insufficiency/occlusion; venous incompetenceNeurogenic: peripheral neuropathy; spinal cord lesionsTraumatic: penectomy; pelvic fracture (with urethral rupture); perineal traumaEndocrine: diabetes mellitus, hypogonadism; hyperprolactinaemia; pituitary, adrenal and thyroid disordersDrugs: e.g. antihypertensives, antidepressantsPost-operative: Cystectomy, Radical Prostatectomy; Abdominoperineal resectionInflammation; urethritis; prostatitisMechanical: congenital penile abnormalities; Peyronies diseaseEndurance related:heart/renal/liver failure; pulmonary insufficiencyPost-priapismSYMPTOMSInability to achieve erectionInability to sustain erectionReduced sexual desireSIGNSFeatures related to underlying causesHypogonadal features e.g. gynaecomastia, lack of male sexual characteristicsPenile plaques and curvature (Peyronies disease)INVESTIGATIONSFBC and sickling statusLipid profileUrinalysisFasting blood glucoseSerum prolactinSerum LH, FSH and testosteroneTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo determine causative factors and treat appropriatelyTo restore sexual potencyNon-pharmacological treatmentPatients should avoid excessive alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, recreational drug abuse and excessive weight gainPsychosexual counselingPharmacological treatmentSildenafil citrate,50 or 100 mg 30 minutes to 1 hour before coitusOrTadalafil, 20 mg 30-60 minutes before coitusOrVerdanafil, 10 or 20 mg 30-60 minutes before coitusProstaglandin E1 must only be used under specialist care.REFERRAL CRITERIAReferral to a specialist centre is necessary for proper evaluation and management in most cases.

Fever is a common complaint, which is usually related to an infection of viral, bacterial or parasitic origin. It may be a valuable guide to the diagnosis and severity of infections.Fever is defined as an axillary temperature above 37.5 °C (read after keeping the thermometer in place for 3 minutes). Fever above 38 °C in children and adults often needs urgent attention, especially if the patient is restless or delirious. Not every fever is due to malaria or typhoid. Every fever should be investigated and treated appropriately.

Fibromyalgia is a disorder of chronic, widespread pain and tenderness. It typically presents in young women in the third decade or middle-aged women but can affect patients of either sex and at any age.Fibromyalgia is a diagnosis of exclusion and often occurs in patients with other conditions, such as autoimmune inflammatory arthritis and osteoarthritis. The clinical evaluation may reveal objective evidence for other co-morbid illness, such as hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyalgia rheumatic and other inflammatory or autoimmune disorders.No clear pathophysiological mechanism for fibromyalgia has been established, but evidence suggests that there is an abnormality in central pain processing.Although there is no cure for fibromyalgia, treatment can relieve some of the symptoms. Since symptoms are numerous and vary among patients, treatment programs must be individualized for each patient. Treatment includes patient education, stress reduction, regular exercise and medications. Always combine pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapy in the treatment of fibromyalgia.

Foreign bodies refer to specks of dust, small insects or other tiny objects that get into the eyes. The foreign body may be either in the conjunctival sac, on the cornea or inside the eyeball (intraocular). A history of the likely nature of the foreign body aids in its detection and removal. The foreign body may be seen by careful inspection of the cornea or conjunctival sac. Adequate lighting is needed to detect corneal foreign bodies.CAUSESSpecks of dustSmall insectsFerrous metallic specs (such as occurs with metal grinders)Other tiny objectsSYMPTOMSFeeling of something in the eye which may be irritatingSudden discomfort or severe painWatering of the eyeRed eye(s)Photophobia i.e. intolerance to lightInability to open the eyeSIGNSEvidence of foreign bodyConjunctivitisTearing of the eyesPhotophobiaChemosisSub-conjunctival haemorrhageIrregular pupil in penetrating eye injury with retained intraocular foreign bodyBlood in the anterior chamber (hyphaema)INVESTIGATIONSX-ray of the orbit (suspected metallic foreign body)TREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo remove superficial foreign bodiesTo treat associated injuryTo prevent complicationsNon-pharmacological treatmentWhere the foreign body is under the upper eyelid, evert the eyelid and remove the foreign body.If the foreign body cannot be removed, apply topical antibiotic, pad the eye and REFER to an eye specialist clinic.Pharmacological treatmentA.

FOURNIER’S GANGRENEIt is an acute fulminant polymicrobial necrotising fascitis or gangrene affecting the scrotum and sometimes extending to the perineum, penis and lower abdomen. It is also called idiopathic gangrene of the scrotum.The synergistic infections of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria coupled with obliterative arteritis results in the extensive gangrene. The risk factors include diabetes mellitus, HIV/Immunosuppression, perineal abscess/ infection of scrotum and contents, trauma, extravasation of urine, periurethral abscess and urethral stricture/calculi. The complications of Fournier's gangrene include septicaemia, extravasation of urine, exposure of testes and fistula formation.CAUSESStaphylococcus sppMicroaerophilic StreptococcusE. coliFusibacteriaClostridium welchiiBacteroidesSYMPTOMSAcute onset of painful anterior scrotal swelling in previously healthy tissueFeverPain in affected scrotumGeneral malaiseSIGNSFeverProstrationRapidly progressing gangreneFoetid odourSharp demarcation between 'dead' tissue and healthy tissueCrepitus on palpation of affected tissueTestis is usually sparedUrinary extravasationPresence of risk or predisposing factorsINVESTIGATIONSWound culture and sensitivitySerum culture and sensitivityUrinalysisFBC and ESRGrouping and cross-matchingFasting blood glucoseHIV screeningPlain X-ray of pelvis will reveal gas in affected tissueTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo resuscitate patientTo treat the infectionTo manage concomitant risk factorsTo salvage the testesTo prevent/treat complicationsNon-pharmacological treatmentSurgical interventionRadical debridementReconstructive surgery:Testis buried in upper thigh temporarily to prevent dessicationSkin grafting and reconstruction of scrotum (scrotoplasty)Myocutaneous flapsNutrition supplementWound careManagement of diabetes mellitus if presentManagement of HIV/AIDS if present Pharmacological treatmentEvidence Rating: [C]IV fluids, haemotransfusion and hyperbaric oxygenAs required for patients clinical stateAntibioticsGentamicin, IV, 80 mg 8 hourlyAndAmpicillin, IV, 500 mg 6 hourlyAndMetronidazole, IV, 500 mg 8 hourlyOrAmoxicillin + Clavulanic Acid, IV, 1 g 12 hourlyAndMetronidazole, IV, 500 mg 8 hourlyOrCefuroxime, IV, 750 mg 8 hourlyAndMetronidazole, IV, 500 mg 8 hourlyREFERRAL CRITERIARefer all cases with septic shock after resuscitation and all those who require reconstructive surgery to a urologist or surgical specialist. 





    
    
    

Poisoning represents the harmful effects of toxic amounts of any substance on the body. In many cases, only mild symptoms and signs will develop. However, suspected poisoning should always be considered a medical emergency since the situation may rapidly evolve to become critical.Many deaths due to poisoning can be prevented with early initiation of good supportive care and general treatment measures. Symptoms and signs of poisoning depend on the specific exposure, and may be local, systemic, or both. Effects may occur immediately, or several hours or days later.The severity depends on many factors, including the type of substance, the route of exposure (ingestion, inhalation, injection, dermal application, etc.), the dose and duration of exposure, and patient or environmental factors.Obtaining the original container or a sample of the substance is often most helpful, along with a thorough history and physical examination and laboratory analysis to look for characteristic features of poisoning with specific agents.Judicious use of antidotes for poisoning with specific substances may be added to general treatment measures based on these findings.A Poison Control Centre exists in Ghana to support health professionals in developing rational and timely strategies for diagnosis and treatment of poisoning.CAUSESHousehold chemicalsPesticidesMedicationsToxic plantsVenomous bites and stingsToxic alcoholsIndustrial chemicalsSYMPTOMSNausea, vomitingDiarrhoeaAbdominal painDifficulty in breathingPalpitationsSkin rashHeadacheConfusionLethargy, weaknessSIGNSAbnormal vital signs (pulse, temperature, respiratory rate)Small pupils (miosis)Large pupils (mydriasis)Excessive sweatingHypersalivationFrequent urinationDiarrhoeaWheezingFlushed dry skinDehydrationShockLow urine output (oliguria, anuria) or retentionAbdominal tendernessJaundiceAltered mentationTremorsSeizureComaINVESTIGATIONSBlood glucose (random)FBCBUE and CreatinineUrinalysisECGLiver function testsClotting timeCoagulation profileNote 28-1Investigations should be individualised to the exposure.

Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy usually but not always associated with raised intraocular pressure. It is the second leading cause of preventable blindness in the world. Chronic Glaucoma may produce severe loss of vision and blindness without prior  warning  symptoms and must therefore be screened for in all adults beyond the age of 40 years. Acute glaucoma is however associated with very high intraocular pressures and very severe pain and inflammation of the eye and can lead to blindness quickly if not treated. When congenital, glaucoma causes enlargement of the eyeball associated with increased sensitivity to light and watering.Pharmacological treatment may vary from patient to patient according to local availability, affordability, and individual response to treatment.CAUSESAcute closure of the drainage angle (due to pupil block in primary angle closure glaucoma)Inadequate drainage of aqueous from the anterior chamber (despite open drainage angles in chronic open angle glaucoma)Neovascular membrane in the drainage angle in ischaemic eye diseases such as proliferative diabetic retinopathyDisplaced lens in secondary angle closure glaucomaMalformation of the drainage angle in congenital glaucomaSYMPTOMS AND SIGNS

A goitre is a swelling of the front of the neck due to enlargement of the thyroid gland. It may affect persons of any age. Not all neck swellings are goitres. Goitres are usually benign but may occasionally be malignant. They could be associated with  normal,  reduced or excessive  function of the thyroid gland. A reduction in production of thyroid hormones results in hypothyroidism while an excess results in hyperthyroidism or thyrotoxicosis. Abnormalities of thyroid hormone production may also occur in the absence of goitre.Proper diagnosis and selection of appropriate surgical or non-surgical treatment of benign and malignant goitres is by full clinical assessment and investigations. Treatment is not necessarily by increasing iodine intake e.g. in iodated salt. Excess iodine intake may actually be harmful in some cases.CAUSESSimple non-toxic goitre or endemic goitreHypothyroidism (See section on 'Hypothyroidism')Hyperthyroidism or Thyrotoxicosis (See section on 'Hyperthyroidism')Thyroid neoplasm - benign or malignantSYMPTOMSSwelling in the neckBreathing and swallowing difficulty, if largeSymptoms of hypothyroidism (See section on 'Hypothyroidism')Symptoms of hyperthyroidism (See section on 'Hyperthyroidism')SIGNSDiffuse (smooth) or nodular (irregular) thyroid swellingSigns of hypothyroidism (See section on 'Hypothyroidism')Signs of hyperthyroidism (See section on 'Hyperthyroidism')INVESTIGATIONSThyroid function tests - free T3, free T4, TSHThyroid ultrasound scanThyroid autoantibodies (if necessary)Radioisotope scan of thyroid (if necessary)Fine needle aspiration cytology (if necessary)X-ray of the neck including thoracic inlet view for large goitresTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo assess and correct level of thyroid hormone productionTo reduce symptoms associated with thyrotoxicosisTo reduce or prevent obstructive symptomsTo identify thyroid neoplasms and manage appropriatelyNon-pharmacological treatmentSubtotal thyroidectomy where indicatedPharmacological treatmentAppropriate treatment of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism (See sections on 'Hypothyroidism' and 'Hyperthyroidism')REFERRAL CRITERIARefer patients to a physician or surgical specialist where complications (e.g. hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, breathing difficulty etc.) or malignancy are suspected or if full clinical assessment and investigations are not possible.





    
    
    

This condition, which typically affects males with cardiovascular risk factors and women after menopause, results from the deposition of uric acid crystals in joints and periarticular tissues. Gout is characterized by pain and inflammation of the affected joints. It is often, but not always, associated with raised blood uric acid levels and may be present even when the level of uric acid in the blood is normal, while patients with highlevelsofuricacidmaynotnecessarilyhaveattacksofgout.Individual gout flares are often triggered by acute increases or decreases in uric acid levels which may be associated with acute alcohol ingestion, acute overindulgence in foods high in purines, rapid weight loss, dehydration, or trauma.CAUSESOverproduction of uric acid in disorders that cause high cell turnover with release of purines found in cell nucleiMyeloproliferative and lymphoproliferative disordersPsoriasisHemolytic anemiasCell lysis from chemotherapy, especially those of the haemato- poietic or lymphatic systemsExcessive exerciseMetabolic syndrome (obesity, diabetes, hypertension, elevated cholesterol etc.)Impaired excretion of uric acidRenal impairmentLead nephropathyStarvation or dehydrationDrugs e.g. thiazide and loop diuretics, cytotoxic drugs, pyrazine- amideAlcohol ingestionInherited purine metabolic disorders e.g. Lesch-Nyhan syndromeSYMPTOMSExcruciating pain and swelling usually of a joint (classically the big toe but may affect the knee, ankles or wrists)Multiple joint painJoint swellingSIGNSInflamed, swollen and tender jointMigratory polyarthritisTophi in soft tissues (helix of the ear, fingers, toes, prepatellar bursa, olecranon)FeverINVESTIGATIONSFBC, ESRBUE,creatinineSerum uricacidBlood glucoseSerum lipidsX-ray of affectedjointJoint aspirate for culture and polarised microscopyTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo relieve acute painTo reduce joint inflammationTo prevent recurrent attacks and joint damageTo prevent uric acid crystal deposition in soft tissuesNon-pharmacological treatmentOptimize weightReduce protein in diet e.g. liver, kidneys, shellfish and yeast extractsReduce alcohol intake to < 14 units/week (men and women)Avoid highly sweetened soft drinks and other beverages or foodsEncourage to drink > 2 litres of water daily and avoid dehydration.Affected joints should be elevated and exposed in a cool environment.

Gastro-oesophageal Reflux Disease (GORD) is caused by backflow of gastric and/or duodenal contents past the lower oesophageal sphincter into the oesophagus without belching or vomiting.The disease is classified into two groups based on endoscopy findings as non-erosive gastro-oesophageal disease (non-erosive GORD) and erosive gastro-oesophageal disease (erosive GORD). Failure to treat may result in oesophagitis, ulceration, strictures and rarely adenocarcinoma.CAUSES•  Obesity•  Hiatus hernia•  Increased intra-abdominal pressure e.g. in pregnancy•  Long term use of nasogastric tube•  Agents that decrease lower oesophageal sphincter pressure e.g. alcohol, cigarettes, anticholinergics (e.g. Hyoscine butylbromide, Propantheline bromide), other drugs - Morphine, Diazepam, Pethidine and Calcium channel blockers•  Children with chronic neurological disease (e.g. cerebral palsy)SYMPTOMS•  Heartburn (worsens with vigorous exercise, bending forward, lying; relieved by antacids and sitting upright)•  Dyspepsia•  Early satiety•  Retrosternal and epigastric pain (mimics angina pectoris by radiating to neck, jaws and arms.

HAEMATURIAThis is the passage of blood in the urine. It may be microscopic or macroscopic, intermittent or continuous. The pattern of blood in the urine maybe initial, terminal or frank/total. Blood in urine is a serious symptom and must always be fully investigated especially to exclude cancer. Certain drugs and food products may colour urine red resulting in false haematuria and these should be differentiated from true haematuria, which is detected by microscopic examination of the urine. Examples    of such substances are rifampicin and rhodamine B food colouring used in cakes, cookies and soft drinks. 0ccasionally vaginal bleeding may be mistaken for haematuria.Definitive treatment depends on the cause.CAUSESGlomerularGlomerulonephritis usually presents with dysmorphic red blood cells in the urine or red blood cell casts with proteinuriaNon-GlomerularUrethra: Trauma, InfectionBladder: Infection, stone, bladder cancer, varices, BPH, prostate cancer drug reaction (cyclophosphamide) radiation cystititis, parasite infestation (S. haematobium)Ureter: Infection, stone, tumour Kidney: Infection (pyelonephritis), stone, anatomic anomalies (Polycystic Kidney Disease, A-V Fistula) renal vein or artery thrombosis,Neoplasms: Renal cell carcinoma (Wilms Tumour)TraumaSickle cell diseaseBenign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) ,Carcinoma of prostate, bladder and kidneyUrinary tract infectionUrinary calculiMedical causes e.g. sickle cell disease, acute glomerulonephritis and anticoagulant therapySYMPTOMSFever suggests infection e.g. pyelonephritis, cystitis and prostatitisColicky flank pain suggests urinary stonesAssociated lower urinary tract symptoms suggest bladder or prostatic causeBlood in the urine (on initiation, mixed with the urine, or at the end of passing urine)Pain/discomfort on passing urine usually associated with infection, calculi or traumaPainless intermittent haematuria associated with cancers eg bladder and kidney cancersLower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) Loin painSIGNSPallorAbdominal masses e.g. kidney, bladderLow or suprapubic tenderness from urinary tract infection or calculusINVESTIGATIONSFBC and sickling status(Hb electrophoresis if sickling test is positive)Blood urea, electrolyte and creatinineUrinalysisUrine culture and sensitivityAbdominal and pelvic ultrasoundTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo treat underlying causeTo arrest bleedingNon-pharmacological treatmentHigh fluid intake is advised in order to prevent clot formation in the urinary bladderIf patient presents with clot retention, then catheterize and referPharmacological treatmentFor Urinary SchistosomiasisEvidence Rating: [A]Praziquantel, oral,(See section on 'Urinary Schistosomiasis')For Urinary Tract InfectionGive appropriate antibiotics (See section on 'Urinary Tract Infection')REFERRAL CRITERIARefer all other cases as well as those with persistent haematuria for appropriate investigations and treatment. 





    
    
    

Haemorrhoids or "piles" are enlarged, displaced anal cushions derived from engorged veins, which primarily presents with anal bleeding. First-degree haemorrhoids remain in the anal canal. Second-degree haemorrhoids prolapse, but reduce spontaneously, whereas third degree haemorrhoids prolapse and have to be replaced manually or remain prolapsed permanently until surgically treated.The history is very important. The nature of the bleeding, associated pain and other symptoms help differentiate haemorrhoids from other more sinister conditions. Always do a digital rectal examination to exclude carcinoma and other conditions when a patient complains of pain or bleeding from the anus. Altered or dark blood, or blood mixed with stools, should raise suspicion of bleeding higher up in the rectum or colon.No treatment is required for haemorrhoids that are asymptomatic. Avoid the use of purgatives.CAUSES•  Increased intra-abdominal pressure e.g. chronic cough, pregnancy, intra-abdominal or pelvic tumours•  Excessive straining at stools from constipation or diarrhoea•  Familial predisposition•  Chronic liver disease with portal hypertension•  Anorectal tumoursSYMPTOMS•  Passage of bright red blood at defaecation•  Not mixed with stools•  May spray the toilet bowl or only found on the toilet paper after cleaning•  Mucoid discharge•  Swelling at anus•  Perianal irritation or itch (pruritus ani)•  Discomfort after opening bowels•  Anal pain (occurs during an acute attack of prolapse with thrombosis, congestion and oedema)•  Symptoms of anaemiaSIGNS•  May be none (inspection of the anus and digital rectal examination may be normal)•  Redundant folds of skin (skin tags) seen in the position of the haemorrhoids.

These are injuries in which the scalp, skull, meninges, brain, or the blood vessels within the brain may be affected separately or together. They are a common cause of death and disability especially in young people. With the advent of increased use of motorbikes as public transport, the incidence has gone up. Head injuries may be open or close, mild, moderate or severe. Symptoms and signs, as well as the treatment modality, will depend on the severity of the injury.Significant head injury is defined as a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)    of less than 10. However, take even mild injuries seriously as these may evolve with time. Continuous monitoring of the patient is required as the situation can change quickly.Corticosteriods have demonstrated no benefits in the treatment    of acute head injury and are no longer recommended for routine management. Sedatives must also not be given except in cases of transporting an aggressive patient.CAUSESRoad traffic accidentsFalls, especially from heightsBlows to the head (fights, including domestic violence, street fights)Gunshot woundsStab woundsChild abuseSYMPTOMSHeadachesDrowsinessLoss of consciousnessVomitingSeizuresMemory lossLeakage of clear fluid or bleeding from the ears or nostrilsIntolerance to light (photophobia)SIGNSLevel of consciousness - may vary from fully conscious to deeply unconscious (use the Glasgow Coma Scale whenever possible)External signs of injuries - abrasions, contusions, lacerations, darkening around the eyes and the back of the earsCSF or blood leakage from the ears/nostrilsPupillary abnormalities - unequal size, pin point or dilatedFocal neurological deficits - paralysis, loss of speech or visionSigns of raised intracranial pressure such as deepening coma, a rising blood pressure, slowing of the pulse rate and irregular respirationOther associated injuriesAlcoholic breath (in cases of intoxication)INVESTIGATIONSFBCBUE, CreatinineBlood glucoseX-ray (skull, cervical spine, chest, pelvis)Head CT scan (also for children)TREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo prevent further injury to the brainTo treat associated injuries Note 23-1Criteria for admission:Loss of consciousness > 5 minsPresence of a fracture on skull X-rayPresence of focal/lateralizing signsPersistent/ recurrent headaches, vomiting or seizuresOpen injuriesCSF otorrhoea or rhinorrhoeaEspecially among Children, and the elderly, or in theAbsence of a reliable adult to look after patient at home, please admit Non-pharmacological treatmentAssess level of consciousness and provide appropriate treatmentMaintain a clear airway, suck out any secretions and assist ventilation if necessaryMaintain the blood pressure (if patient hypotensive or hypertensive)Prevent hypoglycaemiaNurse with head end of bed elevatedStabilize the neck with a collar till cervical spine injury has been excludedIf patient is unconscious, turn every 2 hoursCatheterize patientPass nasogastric tube for feeding if patient is unconscious.

Headache is caused by traction, displacement, inflammation, vascular spasm or distension of the pain sensitive structures in the head or neck. Headaches that are new in onset and clearly different from any the patient has experienced previously are commonly a symptom of serious illness and therefore demand prompt evaluation. The precipitating factors, associated symptoms and clinical findings on examination, together with the results of appropriate investigations, can provide a guide to the cause of the headache.CAUSESAcuteSubarachnoid haemorrhage and other cerebrovascular diseasesInfections e.g. malaria, typhoid fever, viral infectionsMeningitis or encephalitisOcular disorders (glaucoma, acute iritis, refractive errors)Post-seizuresPost-lumbar punctureHypertensive encephalopathySubacuteLesions of the middle ear (otitis media, mastoiditis)Intracranial mass (tumour, subdural haematoma, abscess)Idiopathic intracranial hypertensionTrigeminal neuralgiaPost-herpetic neuralgiaSevere hypertensionAtypical facial painMedicationPost traumaGiant cell temporal arteritisChronicMigraineCluster headacheTension headacheCervical spine diseaseSinusitisDental diseasePsychogenic causesSYMPTOMSVisual e.g. photophobia, flashes of light, floatersAura e.g. visual, auditory, gustatory, tactileAccompanying features e.g. nausea, vomiting, fever, collapseSite of pain e.g. occipital, ocular, unilateral, bilateralCharacteristics e.g. pulsating, throbbing, sharp, dullRelieving or exacerbating factors e.g. cough, coitus, lying flatSIGNSUsually noneLocal tendernessFeverNeck stiffnessPositive KernigsMarkedly elevated blood pressureDrowsinessExcessive lacrimationConjunctival rednessPapilloedemaFocal neurologic deficit e.g. cranial nerve deficit, hemiparesisINVESTIGATIONSFBCESRSkull X-rayCervical X-rayX-ray of the paranasal sinusesLumbar puncture (meningitis, subarachnoid bleed)Eye tests (tonometry, refraction, fundoscopy)Cranial CT scan or MRI if warrantedTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo relieve painTo identify and treat underlying causeTo prevent complications relating to the underlying causeTo improve quality of lifeNon-pharmacological treatmentRelaxation techniquesAvoidance of stressPsychotherapyIdentification and elimination of trigger factorsPharmacological treatmentA.

This is a condition in which the heart is unable to produce adequate cardiac output, and in so doing, is unable to meet the body's metabolic requirements. The cardiac dysfunction may predominantly involve the left or the right ventricle individually or both ventricles simultaneously. This later case is termed Biventricular Failure(BVF) or Congestive Cardiac Failure (CCF).The functional classification of heart failure using the New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classification is described in the table below.

 15. Hepatocellular CarcinomaHepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is a primary malignancy of the liver cell and must be differentiated from malignancies elsewhere that metastasize to the liver. Hepatocellular carcinoma occurs more commonly in men than in women and is often diagnosed several years after establishment of the initial causative condition. The disease has a poor prognosis resulting from metastatic or locally advanced disease. Complications include liver failure, variceal bleeding or tumour rupture with bleeding into the peritoneum. The tumour is often resistant to chemotherapy. Current strategies to prevent or treat hepatitis B and C infections and liver cirrhosis can potentially reduce the prevalence of HCC in the long term.

HERPES SIMPLEX INFECTIONSThese are acute self-limiting viral infections of the skin and mucous membranes resulting in blistering eruptions usually seen on the face (called “cold sores") or the genitalia.

HERPES ZOSTERThis is an acute painful blistering viral infection of the skin. It can occur in childhood but is much more common in adults, especially the elderly, sick or immunosuppressed. The primary infection presents as chickenpox (varicella), usually during childhood. Like herpes simplex, the virus persists usually in the anterior horn cells before it is reactivated. Post- herpetic neuralgia is a common complication and defined as persistence or recurrence of pain more than a month after the onset of shingles.

Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a late stage of infection with the Human Immune Deficiency Virus (HIV). It can affect both adults and children often predisposing them to opportunistic infections and certain malignancies. Co-infection with tuberculosis (TB) and Hepatitis B are particularly frequent in HIV infected individuals and must be screened for in all cases.The main risk factors for HIV/AIDS remain transmission by exchange of body fluids and blood products through sexual contact, transfusion, needle-stick injury, non-sterile surgical practices and mother to child transfer.HIV infection is currently not curable. However, for persons living with HIV infection (PLHIV), effective anti-retroviral therapy (ART) is available country-wide at accredited centres at the regional and district level in both public and private health care facilities to which all diagnosed patients must be referred.Prevention of infection remains the key to reducing its spread.CAUSESHuman Immunodeficiency VirusSYMPTOMSPersistent coughPersistent or recurrent diarrhoeaWeight lossSkin rashesPersistent or recurrent feverMouth ulcersSIGNSWeight lossChronic diarrhoeaProlonged feverGeneralised lymphadenopathyOropharyngeal candidiasisPersistent coughGeneralised dermatitisRecurrent herpes zoster (adults)Chronic progressive and disseminated herpes simplex infections (adults)Finger nail changes e.g. blue discoloration of the nails (adults)Failure to thrive or slow growth (infants and children)Recurrent common infections e.g. otitis media, pharyngitis (infants and children)

Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is short-term antiretroviral treatment to reduce the likelihood of HIV infection after potential exposure by preventing the establishment of infection or preventing new infection. PEP reduces staff exposure to HIV infections at work and also clears possible HIV infection from infected dendritic cells. Workplace accidents or injury expose health workers to body fluids of patients. Risk of exposure to blood and blood borne pathogens is slightly higher for healthcare personnel. The risk of infection for HIV from a percutaneous injury is approximately 0-3% and that of mucous membranes or non- intact skin are much lower. PEP is particularly effective within 1-2 hours and not more than 72 hours after exposure.CAUSESAn exposure considered as possible risk is defined as "an exposure from possibly infected blood tissue or other body fluids through:A percutaneous injury (e.g. a needle stick or cut with a sharp object) orA mucocutaneous membrane or non-intact (chapped, abraded skin) contactThe risk of infection appears to be higher after:Exposure to a large quantity of blood or to other infectious fluidsExposure to the blood of a patient in an advanced HIV disease stage.A deep percutaneous injury or an injury with a hollow bore, blood filled needle.SIGNSNoneSYMPTOMSNoneBox 17-1 Steps to prevent occupational transmission of HIVIn the event of possible exposure to HIV the following actions should be taken:The wound site should be cleaned with soap and waterFor mucous membranes, the exposed area should be flushed with plenty of water (e.g. eyes with water or saline)Assess the level of risk: the risk of possible infection from the exposure should be assessed and classified based on the categories below:Very LowExposure:Exposure of potentially infectious material to intact skin)Low RiskExposure:Exposure to a small volume of blood or body fluids contaminated with blood from asymptomatic HIV-positive patientInjury with a solid needle or any superficial injury or mucocutaneous exposureHigh RiskExposure:Exposureto a large volume of blood or potentially infectious fluidsExposure to blood or body fluids contaminated with blood from an HIV positive patient with high viral loadInjury with a hollow bore needle/deep and extensive injury from a contaminated sharp instrumentExposure to blood from an HIV drug resistant patientINVESTIGATIONSFull blood countLiver and renal function testsHepatitis B Surface AntigenHIV serology or PCR if available TREATMENTTreatment ObjectivesTo prevent establishment of HIV infectionNon-pharmacological treatmentCounselling and Testing:Exposed health workers must receive counselling and testing immediately from a trained counsellor.

This is a life threatening paediatric cardiac emergency.It usually occurs in infants with a peak incidence between 4 and 6 months. A severe episode may lead to limpness, seizures, cerebrovascular accident or even death. Spells may be brief (1-2 minutes)and self-correct or may progress to a severe, life-threatening episode. Prompt recognition by parents and medical staff is important. The attack is often early in the morning with no apparent reason. It may be precipitated following a bath, by prolonged crying, defaecation, dehydration, febrile illness or induction of anaesthesia.CAUSES •Congenital heart disease e.g. Tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary stenosis, double outlet right ventricle, tricuspid atresia, Eisenmenger syndromeSYMPTOMS • Irritability and prolonged crying • Deep rapid breathing • Increased severity of cyanosisSIGNS • Tachycardia • Systolic murmur • Coma • Convulsions • HemiparesisINVESTIGATIONS • FBC • Chest X-ray • ECG • EchocardiographyTREATMENTTreatment objectives • To recognise the problem early • To reverse obstruction • To correct metabolic derangement in severe hypoxia • To prevent complications and death from severe hypoxiaNon-pharmacological treatment • Hold in knee chest position (teach parents) •     The above actions increase peripheral vascular resistance and help to reduce cyanosis.Pharmacological treatmentA.

HYPEREMESIS GRAVIDARUM
This refers to excessive vomiting usually during the early part of pregnancy, and is usually common. It is a diagnosis of exclusion and therefore important to rule out other causes of vomiting such as malaria, urinary tract infection, gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, hepatitis and hypoglycaemia. Surgical conditions such as acute appendicitis, bowel obstruction, cholecystitis and twisted ovarian cyst, should also be excluded. Hyperemesis gravidarum may be associated with multiple pregnancy or molar pregnancy.

Hypertension or 'high blood pressure' carries an increased risk of early death from stroke, heart attack, heart failure and kidney failure if it is not detected early and properly controlled. Owing to this, the focus must be on when to initiate treatment, rather than how hypertension should be defined.Since there are often no specific symptoms associated with hypertension, there is the need for regular blood pressure (BP) screening in the adult population for early detection.In the general adult population, treatment must be initiated at a  BP of 140/90 mmHg or higher for individuals below 60 years of age, and 150/90 mmHg or higher in those above 60 years. For individuals with diabetes mellitus or non-diabetics with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), treatment for hypertension must be initiated at a BP of 140/90 mmHg, irrespective of age.In the majority of patients with hypertension, no specific underlying cause is identified (primary hypertension). In these individuals, increasing age, family history, excess body weight, lack of physical activity and excessive alcohol intake may be possible predisposing factors. In about 10% of cases of hypertension, there may be an underlying kidney disease, endocrine disorder, renal artery stenosis or coarctation of the aorta (secondary hypertension).Once a diagnosis of hypertension is made, the individual should     be evaluated to exclude secondary causes and to identify other existing cardiovascular risk factors e.g. diabetes, dyslipidaemia, hyperuricaemia, etc. CAUSES • Primary hypertension • Secondary hypertension•  Kidney related-CKD, polycystic kidney disease•  Endocrine - phaeochromocytoma, Cushing's syndrome, Conn's syndrome, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, acromegaly•     Vascular - renal artery stenosis, coarctation of the aortaSYMPTOMS • Usually none • Occasionally,•  Headaches•  Palpitations•  Dizziness•  Easy fatiguabilitySIGNS • Blood pressure 2" 140/90 mmHg • Displaced apex beat • Signs pointing to a specific cause for secondary hypertensionINVESTIGATIONS • FBC • Urinalysis • Blood urea, electrolytes and creatinine • Blood glucose • Serum lipids • Serum uric acid • Chest X-ray • 12-lead ECG • Ultrasound scan of kidneys and adrenals (in suspected secondary hypertension) • EchocardiogramTREATMENTTreatment objectives • To reduce blood pressure levels to recommended targets:•  < 140/90mmHg for age below 60 years, diabetes, CKD•  < 150/90 mmHg for age above 60 years • To manage co-morbid conditions e.g. obesity, diabetes, lipids etc. • To prevent cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and renal complications • To promote therapeutic lifestyle changes e.g. smoking cessation, regular physical activity, reduction in alchohol intake • To identify and manage secondary hypertension appropriatelyNon-pharmacological treatment • Reduce salt intake • Reduce animal fat intake • Ensure regular fruit and vegetable intake • Weight reduction in obese and overweight individuals • Regular exercise e.g. brisk walking for 30 minutes 3 times a week • Reduction in alcohol consumption • Avoid or quit smoking Pharmacological treatmentA.

Hypertension in children is defined as an average systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure that is 2" 95th percentile for gender, age, and height on 3 or more separate occasions taken in the right arm (in view  of possibility of coarctation of aorta). An appropriate cuff size that covers two thirds (½) of the length of the arm (between shoulder and elbow) and encircling the whole arm, should be used.In general, a blood pressure of > 110/70 mmHg in children aged 2-5 years and > 115/76mmHg in those aged 6-12 years and more than 128/82 mmHg in adolescents is considered abnormal and would require a referral to, and evaluation by a paediatrician.Most adolescent and childhood hypertension, especially in infants and younger children, is due to secondary causes (See section on 'Hypertension in Adults'). Adolescents, however, may have early onset primary hypertension.CAUSES • Renal e.g. chronic pyelonephritis, hydronephrosis • Vascular e.g. coarctation of aorta, renal artery stenosis • Endocrine e.g. phaeochromocytoma, Cushing's syndrome, adrenaldisorders • Obesity • Primary hypertensionSYMPTOMS • Chest pain • Headaches • Dyspnoea on exertion • Excessive sweating • Leg swelling • Palpitations • Haematuria • Unconsciousness (hypertensive encephalopathy)SIGNS • BP >110/70 mmHg in children aged 2-5 years• >115/76 mmHg in children aged 6-12 years• >128/82 mmHg in adolescents • Signs pointing to a specific cause for secondary hypertensionINVESTIGATIONS(See section on 'Hypertension in Adults')TREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo reduce blood pressure (BP) to a target of < 95th percentile for age, gender and height in the absence of end organ-damage (to < 90th percentile if end organ damage present)To prevent complicationsTo manage underlying secondary causeTo encourage weight reduction in obese and overweight childrenNon-pharmacological treatmentTherapeutic lifestyle changesweight controlregular exerciselow fat intakelow sodium dietregular fruit and vegetable intakePharmacological treatmentEvidence Rating: [A]Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitorsEnalapril, oral,Children12-18 years; initially 2.5 mg daily (increased to max. 10- 20 mg daily in 1-2 divided doses)1 month-12 years;  initially 100 micrograms per kg daily (in- creased to max. 1 mg/kg daily in 1-2 divided doses)Neonate10 microgram/kg daily (increased to max. 500 microgram/kg daily in 1-3 divided doses)DiureticsBendroflumethiazide, oral,Children12-18 years;   2.5 mg daily2-12 years;  50-100 microgram/kg daily1 month-2 years;   50-100 microgram/kg dailyBeta blockersPropranolol, oral,Children12-18 years;  80-160 mg 12 hourly1 month-12 years;  250 microgram-1 mg/kg 8 hourlyNeonate;   250 microgram/kg 8 hourly 0rAtenolol, oral,Children0.5-1 mg/kg daily (max. 2 mg/kg daily)Calcium channel blockersNifedipine, oral,Children12-18 years;  5-20 mg 8 hourly1 month-12years; 200-300 microgram/kg 8 hourly (max. 100 mg daily)OrAmlodipine, oral,Children12-18 years;5-10 mg daily1 month-12years; 100-400 microgram/kg daily (max. 10 mg daily)VasodilatorsHydralazine, oral,Children12-18 years;  25 mg 12 hourly increased to usual max. 50- 100 mg 12 hourly1 month-12 years; 250-500 microgram/kg 8-12 hourly in- creased as necessary to max. 7.5 mg/kg daily (not exceeding200 mg) Neonate;  250-500 microgram/kg 8-12 hourly increased as necessary to max. 2-3 mg/kg every 8 hoursIV, 250-500 microgram/kg diluted in 10 ml normal saline given over 20 minutes, then 100-200 microgram/kg 4-6 hourly (max 3 mg/kgin 24 hours)Angiotensin-receptor blockers •Losartan, oral,ChildrenInitial dose;  0.7 mg /kg daily (max. 50 mg) Maintenance dose;  1.4 mg /kg daily (max. 100 mg)REFERRAL CRITERIARefer all cases of hypertension in children to a specialist forinvestigation and further treatment.



HYPERTENSION IN PREGNANCY
Hypertension in pregnancy denotes a systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or higher and/or diastolic pressure of 90 mmHg or higher on 2 occasions at least 5 minutes apart using an appropriate-sized cuff especially in obese patients. It is severe when systolic blood pressure is 160 mmHg or higher and diastolic blood pressure is 110 mmHg or higher. This includes women whose hypertension was diagnosed prior to pregnancy as well as during pregnancy. Known hypertensives on ACE inhibitors, ARBs and alpha-blockers should be switched to medications considered safe during pregnancy.
CAUSES

Pregnancy-induced hypertension (no proteinuria)
Pre-eclampsia (hypertension with proteinuria)
Eclampsia (hypertension with proteinuria and fits)

A hypertensive crisis is a severe and potentially life threatening increase in blood pressures (BP) which may result in an acute stroke, subarachnoid haemorrhage, seizures (hypertensive encephalopathy), heart attack, acute dissection of aorta, heart failure, renal damage or eclampsia (during pregnancy). The underlying cause may be primary hypertension; however, secondary causes of hypertension must be excluded.In adult patients this often occurs with a BP > 180/120 mmHg, while in children this may occur at lower BP levels. These patients need careful examination to exclude target organ damage. Rapid correction of blood pressure with careful monitoring to avoid a precipitous drop is indicated to prevent organ damage.SYMPTOMSHeadacheChest painShortness of breathNauseaVomitingConfusionSeizuresUnconsciousnessSIGNSSeverely elevated blood pressure (for age)UnconsciousnessSeizuresNeck rigidityLung crepitationsINVESTIGATIONSChest X-ray12-lead ECGFBCUrinalysisBlood urea, electrolytes and creatinineBrain CT scan (for stroke)Chest CT scan with angiography (for suspected aortic dissection)Cardiac enzymes: creatinine kinase-MB (CK-MB), serum aspartate transaminase (AST), serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and troponins (for acute coronary syndrome)EchocardiographyTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo limit further organ-related complications by controlled reduction of BPTo control and subsequently prevent seizures if presentTo manage identified target organ damageNon-pharmacological treatmentStrict bed restPharmacological treatmentEvidence Rating: [A]Labetalol, IV,Adults20-50 mg stat.

Hypothyroidism is a condition associated with reduction in thyroid hormone production. Thyroid hormone is required for normal metabolism and growth. Its deficiency has major consequences on foetal development as well as intellectual and physical development in infants and children (cause of cretinism).In adults, it may be the cause of several problems including heart disease, menstrual irregularity and infertility, mental health conditions and dementia. Iodine replacement is not the treatment for hypothyroidism.Screening for hypothyroidism in all newborns, and every 5 years in adults after age 35 years, especially females, by measuring TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) levels in blood where this is possible, should be encouraged.CAUSESAntibody-related thyroid gland destructionSubtotal thyroidectomyPituitary surgery or lesionsCongenitalSevere iodine deficiencyDrug induced (e.g. radioiodine therapy, amiodarone etc.)SYMPTOMSGeneral weakness and tirednessIntolerance to cold environmentsConstipationWeight gainHair lossDry skinHoarse voiceMemory lossGoitre may be presentAbnormal menstrual periods and sub-fertility (in adult females)Poor growth, development and poor school performance in childrenSIGNSNeonateProlonged neonatal jaundiceExcessive sleepFeeding problemsCHILDRENCretinism (mental subnormality, short stature, large tongue, dry skin, sparse hair, protuberant abdomen, umbilical hernia, abnormal facies)ADULTSSlow pulse (usually <60 per minute)Dry coarse skinPuffy facePallorHoarse voiceSlow reflexesDementiaGoitre may be presentINVESTIGATIONSThyroid function tests - free T3, free T4, TSHFasting blood lipids (for elevated cholesterol level)TREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo correct blood level of thyroid hormonesTo maintain lifelong normal levels of thyroid hormonesNon-pharmacological treatmentSurgical intervention for pituitary lesions where necessaryPharmacological treatmentA.

The idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) are systemic connective tissue diseases, which are characterized by symmetrical, proximal muscle weakness, reduced muscle strength and chronic inflammation in muscle tissue. These are rare disorders, and affects more women than men. Although the peak age of onset is in the 50s, the disorders can occur at any age. The word "juvenile" is used in the name when a child is affected by myositis.Adults with inflammatory myopathies, have an increased risk of cancer including cancer of the lung, breast, prostate, and ovaries etc.CAUSESUnknownAutoimmuneSYMPTOMSMuscle weakness (around the neck, shoulders and hips)Trouble climbing stairs, getting up from a seat, or reaching for objects overheadPain in the musclesChoking while eatingAspiration of foodSIGNSProximal muscle weaknessAspiration pneumoniaGottron's sign or Gottron's papules (rash over the back of the fingers, elbows or knees)Shawl sign (flat, reddened area that appears on the upper back, shoulders, and back of the neck)Photosensitive rashHeliotrope rashNail bed abnormalitiesMechanic’s handsAlopeciaInterstitial lung diseaseCalcium deposits in the skin(calcinosis)INVESTIGATIONSCreatine kinase levelsAntinuclear Antibodies (ANA)Hepatitis B and C screenHIV TestMuscle biopsyMRI scan of the musclesElectromyogram (EMG)TREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo improve muscle strengthTo minimize long-term muscle damageTo prevent complications from muscle weaknessTo reduce treatment side effectsNon-pharmacological treatmentPhysical therapy and rehabilitation to prevent contracturesAvoidance of exposure to direct sunlightAppropriate feeding techniques to prevent aspirationPharmacological treatmentA.

ImmunisationImmunisation against vaccine preventable diseases through the national Expanded Programme for Immunisation (EPI) is one of the most effective measures of reducing morbidity, disability and mortality in the population, especially, in children.Ghana currently has 12 (twelve) vaccines in the immunisation schedule, namely, BCG, oral poliomyelitis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, haemophilus influenzae type B, pneumococcus, rotavirus, measles, rubella and yellow fever. Newer vaccines may be introduced in the near future as they are discovered and found effective. Immunisation is recommended for the following persons: • High risk groups (e.g. during a disease outbreak or by virtue of being exposed) • Young children • Elderly • The malnourished The current schedule for routine Immunisation for children under 5 years is as follows:Evidence Rating [A]
     
        
            
            
            
                
                

    
    
    Immunisation of preterm babies: • Consider all premature babies for full immunisation course. • Start immunisation in 2nd month after birth (after 4 weeks) irrespective of degree of prematurity. Give BCG on discharge. • Delay OPV in neonatal unit since there is a small chance of transfer of 0PV virus to other babies. Hence give 0PV on discharge from nursery- not while still on admission. Contraindications to Immunisation: • Current serious febrile illness: delay vaccine • History of severe reaction after previous dose (e.g. anaphylactic reaction) - avoid • Evolving neurological disease (e.g. uncontrolled epilepsy) - avoid whole cell pertussis vaccine • No DPT or DPT/HepB/Hib to child with convulsion/shock within 3 days of the most recent dose of DPT or DPT/HepB/Hib • No DPT or DPT/HepB/Hib to child with recurrent convulsions or active CNS disease • Yellow fever vaccine should not be given if there is history of anaphylaxis with ingestion of egg • Individuals with symptomatic HIV infection should not receive BCG and yellow fever vaccines since these are live vaccines. BCG vaccine can be given at birth since the HIV infected newborn is asymptomatic. Live vaccines should not be given to the following: • Pregnant women - for risk of teratogenic effect • Patients with malignant disease e.g. leukaemia, Hodgkins disease • Malignant disease of the reticuloendothelial system, • Patients with immune suppression, including Symptomatic HIV patients • Patients on chemotherapy (defer for 6 months after stopping chemotherapy treatment)However: • Measles vaccine should be given to HIV positive patients even though it is a live vaccine because the benefit outweighs the risk REFERRAL CRITERIARefer all problems related to Immunisation to a paediatrician or EPI specialist.





    
    
    

IMPETIGOImpetigo is a highly contagious superficial bacterial skin infection. It is common in neonates and children and may be associated with conditions such as scabies, eczema, lice infestation and herpes simplex infection as secondary infection. The condition does not cause any symptoms until four to 10 days after initial exposure. It usually improves within a week of treatment. There are two types of impetigo. The non-bullous type typically affects the skin around the nose and mouth, causing lesions to develop, that quickly burst to leave a yellow-brown crust. The other type, bullous impetigo, typically affects the trunk causing fluid-filled blisters (bullae) to develop that burst after a few days to leave a yellow crust. Both types of impetigo may leave behind marks when the crusts have cleared up, but these usually improve over the following days or weeks. Its prevention involves good hygiene, regular hand-washing, trimming of fingernails to reduce breaking of the skin through scratching, and discouraging the sharing of towels and clothing.

Insomnia is defined as a subjective report of difficulty with sleep initiation, duration, consolidation, or quality that occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep, and that results in some form of daytime impairment. Insomnia symptoms occur quite commonly in the general population. Risk factors for insomnia include increasing age, female sex, co-morbid disorders such as medical, psychiatric, substance use, and shift work. Patients with psychiatric and chronic pain disorders have relatively high rates of insomnia.CAUSESBehavioural - spending more time in bed in an effort to "catch up" on sleepStressLearned habits which do not enhance sleepCognitive distortions (e.g. if one does not sleep throughout the night, one has not slept at all)Medicines (e.g.for treatment of common cold, hypertension, asthma)Caffeine-containing beverages (e.g. coffee, tea)Withdrawal from alcohol and other drugs of abuse (e.g. cocaine, marijuana, amphetamines)Medical condition (e.g. sleep apnea, airway obstruction, liver disease, renal disease, thyroid disorders)Psychological and environmental factorsOther psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and mood disordersTravel (especially across time zones leading to jet lag)Shift workSYMPTOMSProlonged average time for falling asleep - longer than 30 minutesTotal sleep time less than 6.5 hoursDifficulty falling asleepFrequent awakeningsDifficulty returning to sleepAwakening too early in the morningSleep that does not feel restful, refreshing or restorativeAnticipating poor sleep hours before bedtime, and becoming more alert and anxious as bedtime approachesDaytime effects of poor sleep:Fatigue and sleepinessMood disturbances and cognitive difficultiesPoor quality of life (worsened by interpersonal difficulties, or avoidance of day activities)Exacerbation of co-morbid conditions such as depression, high blood pressure, etc.Day-to-day variabilityBox 10-1: History taking and assessment of patients with InsomniaCharacterization of the sleeping environment (couch/bed, light/dark, qui- et/noisy, room temperature, alone/bed partner, TV on/off), patient's state of mind (sleepy vs. wide awake, relaxed vs. anxious)Identify perpetuating negative behaviours and cognitive processesAssess Sleep-Wake Schedule with sleep dairy: time to fall asleep (sleep latency), number of awakenings, Wake time After Sleep Onset (WASO), sleep durationAssessBreathing-related sleep disorders (snoring, gasping, coughing)Sleep related movement disorders (kicking, restlessness)Parasomnias (behaviors or vocalization)Co-morbid medical/neurological disorders (reflux, palpitations, seizures, headaches)0ther physical sensations and emotions associated with wakefulness (such as pain, restlessness, anxiety, frustration, sadness)Assess Daytime Activities and Daytime Function:Napping (frequency/day, times, voluntary/involuntary)Work (work times, work type such as driving or with dangerous consequences, disabled, caretaker responsibilities)Lifestyle (sedentary/active, homebound, light exposure, exercise)Travel (especially across time zones)Quality of life and exacerbation of co-morbid disorders INVESTIGATIONSFBCBUE and creatinineLFTsBlood glucoseThyroid function testsTREATMENTTreatment objectivesReduction of waking symptomsImprovement of daytime functionReduction of distressTreatment of co-morbid conditions Non-pharmacological treatmentStimulus control therapy (avoid stimulating sleep environments such as leaving lights, TV and radio on)Relaxation trainingCognitive Behavior TherapyAvoidance of day-time sleepAvoidance of excessive stimulant consumption pre-bed time (e.g.coffee, tea, alcohol etc.) Pharmacological treatment 1st Line Treatment Evidence Rating: [C]Lorazepam, oral,ADULTS1-4 mg at bedtimeCHILDRENNot recommendedOrTriazolam, oral,ADULTSElderly;  125-250 microgram at bedtime< 60 years; 125-500 microgram at bedtimeCHILDRENNot recommended2nd Line Treatment Evidence Rating: [B]Melatonin, oral, (particularly for children)ADULTS3-5 mg daily, 1-2 hours before bedtime (max. 10 mg)CHILDREN1 month-18 years; 2-3 mg at bedtimeIncrease if necessary after 1-2 weeks to 4-6 mg daily (max. 10 mg)OrEvidence Rating: [B]Amitriptyline, oral,ADULT25-50 mg at night for two weeksCHILDRENNot recommended REFERRAL CRITERIARefer to clinical psychologist for those patients who do not respond to the common non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions for cognitive behaviour therapy.

42. Ischaemic Heart DiseaseIschaemic heart disease is a condition whereby there is reduced blood supply to the heart muscle. It comprises of stable angina pectoris and the acute coronary syndromes. STABLE ANGINA PECTORISStable angina pectoris is pain or discomfort that occurs in the front of the chest, and may radiate to the neck, shoulders, jaw or arms. The chest pain is typically induced by exertion or emotional stress and relieved by rest or glyceryl trinitrate. Individuals who experience stable angina pectoris are at a high risk of developing acute coronary syndromes or a heart attack. Risk factors include diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cigarette smoking, plasma lipid abnormalities, obesity, family history of heart disease and persistently elevated markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein.Risk factors for this condition include obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking, hyperlipidaemia.CAUSESAtherosclerosis with narrowing of the coronary blood vesselsSpasms of the coronary arteries SYMPTOMSCentral or precordial chest painMay radiate into the left arm, neck or jawRelieved by restRelieved by glyceryl trinitrate SIGNSNo typical signs INVESTIGATIONS12-lead ECGCardiac enzymes: creatinine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and troponinsBlood glucoseBlood lipid profileFBCChest X-rayStress ECGEchocardiographyCoronary angiography TREATMENT Treatment objectivesTo minimise symptomsTo prevent progression to acute coronary syndromesTo identify and manage modifiable risk factorsTo improve quality of life Non-pharmacological treatment      Educate and reassure patien      Healthy lifestyle modifications:DietExerciseWeight managementReduction in alcohol consumptionAvoid or quit smoking Pharmacological treatmentA.

    ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROMEAcute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) is a term that describes symptoms resulting from severe acute myocardial ischaemia. The ischaemia may, or may not, lead to myocardial infarction (heart attack). ACS is classified as ST segment elevation on an electrocardiogram (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction - STEMI) or a non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina (an ACS without elevation of cardiac enzymes). The risk factors for ACS are identical to those for, and include previous episodes of, stable angina pectoris.Risk factors for this condition include obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking and hyperlipidaemia.CAUSES•     Atherosclerosis or obstruction of the coronary blood vessels leading to reduction in blood supply to the heart muscleSYMPTOMSChest painSudden onsetVarying degree but often severe and described as tightness, heaviness or constrictive in nature.Persisting for more than 30 minutesNot relieved by rest or glyceryl trinitrateMay radiate to the left arm, the neck or jawNauseaVomitingShortness of breath or fatigue (this may be the only presentation in diabetics and the elderly) Loss of consciousness SIGNSRestlessness and apprehensionExcessive sweatingPeripheral or central cyanosisPulse may be thready, fast, irregular, slow or normalBlood pressure may be high, low or unrecordable (following extensive damage to heart muscle)Bilateral crepitations in the chest (with left ventricular failure)Presence of a third or fourth heart sound (suggests heart failure)Confusion in the elderly INVESTIGATIONSStandard 12 lead ECGCardiac enzymes: CK-MB, troponins T and IMyoglobinSerum lipid profileChest X-rayRandom blood glucoseFBC, ESRSerum uric acidBlood urea, electrolytes and creatinineC-reactive proteinEchocardiographyCoronary angiography TREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo relieve distress and painTo limit infarct sizeTo prevent and treat complicationsTo reverse cardiac remodellingTo prevent re-infarctionTo identify and manage modifiable risk factorsTo improve quality of life Non-pharmacological treatmentReassure patient and encourage bed rest in the first 48 hoursEncourage cessation of smoking Ensure weight reduction (in overweight and obese individuals) in the long term Pharmacological treatmentA.

9.  JaundiceJaundice refers to yellow pigmentation of skin, palms and the sclerae as a result of elevated levels of bilirubin in blood. It may be visible when serum levels exceed 35 micromol/L in adults and 100 micromol/L in children. The symptoms and signs that accompany jaundice often provide helpful clues to the underlying cause.In adults and children, hyperbilirubinaemia may result in hepatic encephalopathy (See sections on 'Acute and Chronic Hepatitis' and 'Hepatic Encephalopathy'). Jaundice in neonates can result in kernicterus (bilirubin encephalopathy) because of the consequences of hyperbilirubinaemia on the brain of the newborn. (See section on 'Neonatal Jaundice') CAUSESAdultsHepatitis - viral, alcoholic, drug-induced including allopathic and herbal preparationsHaemolysis - various causes including malaria, Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and sickle cell disease, allopathic drugs and herbal preparationsChronic liver diseases - decompensated cirrhosis, biliary cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis, hepatocellular carcinomaLiver malignancies - hepatocellular carcinoma, metastatic liver diseaseHepatic congestion from heart failureGall bladder diseases - stones, infectionsCarcinoma of head of pancreasSepticaemia ChildrenHaemolysis - sickle cell disease, G6PD deficiency, drugsInfections - malaria, hepatitis, urinary tract infections, typhoid fever and other septicaemic illnesses Pregnancy  (See section on 'Jaundice in Pregnancy')Neonates  (See section on 'Neonatal Jaundice') SYMPTOMSYellow or greenish discolouration of the eyes or skinDeep yellow discolouration of urineItchingPale stools SIGNSPallor (may indicate haemolysis, chronic disease or malignancy)Scratch marks (indicative of cholestasis)Stigmata of chronic liver disease (e.g. palmar erythema, clubbing, spider naevi)Hepatomegaly (may be tender)Splenomegaly in portal hypertensionPalpable gall bladderAscitesBleeding (cephalhaematoma subgaleal, haematoma, upper gastrointestinal bleeding)Hepatic flap (indicative of liver failure) INVESTIGATIONSAdults and childrenFBCINRSickling statusG6PD statusBlood film for red cell anomalies, malaria parasitesLiver function testsUrea and electrolytesHepatitis screen (HBsAg, HCV Antibody, Hepatitis A IgM, Hepatitis E IgM)Blood cultureUrinalysisAbdominal ultrasoundAbdominal CT scan TREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo identify and treat cause of jaundiceTo relieve symptoms associated with jaundiceTo prevent complications associated with elevated levels of bilirubin in the blood Non-pharmacological treatmentAdults and children(See section on 'Hepatic encephalopathy', Hepatitis')Avoid alcohol and other hepatotoxic agentsEnsure adequate hydration Pharmacological treatmentA.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis results from abnormally regulated Immune responses that lead to inflammation of joints, surrounding tissues and other organs, often, non-rheumatic diseases that can cause similar features need to be excluded during evaluation. Rheumatoid arthritis in children may present in one of three forms; a systemic onset arthritis (Still’s disease), poly-articular onset arthritis (5 or more joints usually of both large and small affected) either of which may be rheumatoid factor positive or negative. Those with positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA) test need regular eye checks for uveitis. For this condition, it is mandatory for arthritis to be present for at least 6 weeks for the diagnosis to be made.

LARGE CHRONIC ULCERSAn ulcer or sore is a breach in the continuity of the skin and the underlying tissue. Large ulcers can cause a lot of morbidity and lead to serious complications. Predisposing and underlying disease  needs  to be investigated. Complications include deformity, ankylosis of joints, osteomyelitis, cellulitis and malignant transformation of ulcers. Surgical treatment may be needed. CAUSESInfections and infestations e.g. Buruli ulcers, yaws ulcers, tuberculous ulcers, guinea worm ulcersNon-specific ulcers e.g. pressure (decubitus), traumatic, venous, diabetic, sickle cell ulcers, ischaemicMalignant ulcers e.g. squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, Kaposi's sarcoma SYMPTOMSPainLoss of sensation at site of ulcerDischarge, which may be offensiveSevere disfigurementDisability SIGNSSloping edges (non-specific ulcers)Undermined edges (buruli and tuberculous ulcers)Punched out edges (yaws ulcers)Raised everted edges (malignant ulcers)Loss of sensation in affected part (diabetes, leprosy, yaws or syphilis ulcers)Deformity of affected partWound discharge (purulent or offensive)Gangrene of affected part (diabetes, peripheral vascular disease)Darkening of affected area (peripheral vascular disease, venous insufficiency)Pink granulation tissue without slough (healthy wound) INVESTIGATIONSFBC, ESRSickling testFasting blood glucoseWound swab for culture and sensitivity, Ziehl Nielsen stainingVDRL/RPR testX-ray of underlying boneBiopsy of ulcer TREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo deslough the ulcer and promote healthy granulation tissue formationTo promote healingTo identify and manage any underlying causeTo prevent complications Non-pharmacological treatmentChange dressing dailyUse absorbent dressing for wounds that have profuse dischargeDeslough wounds that have adherent sloughElevate lower limb on sittingAdequate nutrition Pharmacological treatmentEvidence Rating: [C]     A.

Leukaemia is cancer of the blood cells.  There are two main types  of leukaemia, which are lymphoid leukaemia and myeloid leukaemia. Each type of leukaemia can be classified as acute (where the patient falls suddenly ill) and chronic (where the patient may have been harbouring the disease for months without knowing). Thus in all, there are 4 main types of leukaemia: acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL), chronic lymphoid leukaemia (CLL), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML).ALL is commonest in children especially boys, CLL is commonest in the elderly, AML and CML cut across all age groups and sexes.The abnormal leukaemic cells especially in acute leukaemia, fill the marrow and prevent the marrow from producing the normal blood cellsi.e. red cells, white cells and platelets leading to anaemia, neutropaenia and thrombocytopaenia, respectively.CAUSESUsually unknownAssociated factorsViruses e.g. human T lymphotrophic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and epstein barr virus (EBV)Chemicals e.g. benzene, industrial solvents, pesticides(lindane), dyes,Drugs e.g. alkylating agents such as melphalanIonizing radiationSYMPTOMSAcute LeukaemiaFeverLymph node swellingEasy fatiguabilityBruising tendenciesBone and joint pain (especially in children)Chronic LeukaemiaAsymptomaticDragging sensation (left side of abdomen)Easy satietyLymph node swellingWeight lossGeneralized itchExcessive sweatingPriapismHearing lossSIGNSAcute LeukaemiaPallorFeverSkin and mucosal haemorrhagesGum hypertrophy (AML subtype 5)Firm, rubbery, non-tender lymph nodes (lymphoid leukaemia)SplenomegalyChronic LeukaemiaSplenomegalyWeight lossPallorGeneralized lymph node enlargement in CLLINVESTIGATIONSFBC and blood film commentBone marrow aspirateUric acid levelsLDHBUE and creatinineLiver function testsSeptic screen (especially in acute leukaemia)LP for CSF cytology (especially in acute lymphoid leukaemia)TREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo aim for a cure in ALL in both children and adultsTo achieve remission and prolong good quality life in AMLTo aim for a complete haematological remission or cure in philadelphia positive CMLTo control white cell counts, symptoms and prolong good quality of life in philadelphia negative CMLTo provide supportive treatment (pain relief, transfusion support, treat infections,counselling)Non-pharmacological treatmentEnsure good hydrationEnsure good nutrition and food hygieneEnsure good oral and personal hygienePharmacological treatmentA.

Local anaesthetic (LA) agents are drugs that reversibly block nerve transmission. They are used to provide anaesthesia to specific areas of the body and can also be used for analgesia.Local anaesthetics also affect transmission in motor nerves; hence, motor weakness may occur following a local anaesthetic, depending on the site of application.Adrenaline is added to local anaesthetics to delay absorption and thus prolong their action. The usual concentration of adrenaline added to a local anaesthetic is 1:200,000.Local anaesthetics with adrenaline should never be used where the blood supply is by end arteries e.g. should not be used for digital nerve blocks. They are also contraindicated in intravenous regional anaesthesia (IVRA).Commonly used LAs in our sub-region are lignocaine and bupivacaine.A. Lidocaine (Lignocaine)Advantage - rapid onset of actionDuration - about 1 hourMaximum dose of plain lidocaine - 3 mg/kg (approx. 200 mg in adult)Maximum dose of lidocaine with adrenaline - 7 mg/kgLidocaine is not recommended for spinal anaesthesiaB. BupivacaineAdvantage - long actingDisadvantages - cardiotoxic, slow onset of actionMaximum dose is 2 mg/kg (for both plain and with adrenaline added)Bupivacaine should be used with caution. Apart from general resuscitative measures, intralipid 20% is effective for the treatment of cardiotoxicity.C.

Malaria is a very common infection in Ghana. It follows the introduction of protozoan malaria parasites into the bloodstream by the bite of an infected female Anopheles mosquito. Malaria is a major cause of significant morbidity and mortality especially among vulnerable individuals, such as children under 5 years of age, pregnant women (sometimes with adverse foetal and maternal outcomes), patients with sickle cell disease and visiting non-resident Ghanaians and expatriates.Based on the clinical severity, cases of malaria are categorized as either 'uncomplicated' or 'severe'. A diagnosis of malaria can be suspected based on the patient's symptoms and the physical findings at examination. However, for a definitive diagnosis to be made laboratory tests (blood film and/or Rapid Diagnostic Test) must demonstrate the malaria parasites or their components since the clinical presentation of the condition can be similar to other common diseases such as typhoid fever, urinary tract infection, septicaemia, pneumonia and meningitis in both adults and children and measles, otitis media, tonsillitis, etc. in children.In Ghana, diagnosis is progressively being shifted from clinical to laboratory confirmation as the basis for treatment. Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) may be used to confirm a diagnosis if microscopy (blood film) is not available.Preventive measures in the community mainly target elimination  of the insect vector or prevention of mosquito bites while additional chemoprophylaxis is required for vulnerable individuals.The development of resistance of malaria parasites to anti-malarial medications is a matter of major public health concern. This phenomenon is largely the result of 'over-diagnosis' and wrong diagnosis of malaria   by healthcare practitioners and patients alike, with its attendant over- treatment and sometimes partial or incomplete treatment, leading to over-exposure of the parasites to the anti-malarial drug (drug pressure). Additionally, Artemisinin Combination Therapy (ACT), rather than monotherapy with artemisinin derivatives, is currently recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria to prevent the development of drug resistance.It  is therefore  necessary  to obtain  laboratory  confirmation of   a diagnosis of malaria before starting treatment. Exceptions to this principle are children under 5 years and cases of suspected severe malaria where laboratory confirmation is not immediately possible. In such circumstances, a complete course of the appropriate anti-malarial medication(s) must be given.

Pregnancy makes women more likely to get malaria or die from malaria. Malaria infection is more severe during pregnancy while pregnancy and its outcomes can become complicated by it. The effects of malaria on the pregnant mother include a severe form of the illness, anaemia, miscarriage, pre-term labour, and post-partum haemorrhage. Risks to the foetus include foetal anaemia, pre-maturity, intra-uterine growth restriction, low birth weight, stillbirth, congenital malaria, and increased perinatal mortality. Preventive measures must be emphasised (i.e. Insecticide-treated Nets [ITNs] and Intermittent Preventive Treatment in pregnancy [IPTp] under direct observation) while confirmed cases must be treated promptly.TREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo ensure prompt and effective case managementNon-pharmacological treatmentNonePharmacological treatmentA.

Intermittent Preventive Treatment in Pregnancy (IPTp)IPTp consists of giving the fixed-dose combination medication Sulphadoxine Pyrimethamine (SP) in treatment doses at predefined intervals after quickening (16 gestational weeks). Current recommendation is that IPTp with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) be given to all pregnant women at each scheduled antenatal care visit except during the first trimester. WH0 recommends a schedule of four focused antenatal care visits for normal pregnancy. In Ghana, the national malaria control strategy reserves SP for the purpose of intermittent preventive treatment only.To prevent the development of drug resistance, SP is not to be used for other purposes such as treatment of acute attacks of malaria.Sulphadoxine (500 mg)-Pyrimethamine (25 mg), oral,Note 18-16Co-administered as Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) during antenatal visits on at least 3 occasions and at most on 7 occasions.

MALE INFERTILITYInfertility is the failure of a couple to achieve conception within   12 months of adequate unprotected coitus. About one third of cases of infertility result from pathologic factors in men, one third from factors in both men and women and one third from factors in females. Male causes therefore account for 50% of infertility. About15% of all married couples experience reproductive difficulties. Components of infertility history include medical, surgical, fertility, sexual, family, medication, social and occupational history.CAUSESFor practical purposes the main causes can be divided into three:Treatable causesPotentially treatable causesUntreatable causes

This refers to a group of disorders characterized by malignant proliferation of lymphoid tissue usually presenting as lymph node swellings. There are 2 major histological types distinguished by the presence or absence of the Reed Sternberg (RS) cell. The 2 main groups are Hodgkin's lymphoma (RS cell present) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (RS cell absent). No age is exempt although generally the incidence of non- Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) increases with age and immunosuppression while Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) shows a bimodal peak, in that there is a high incidence in the third and seventh decades. Burkitt's lymphoma, a subtype of NHL, is one of the fastest growing tumours known in man. There are three clinical variants - the endemic, sporadic and immunodeficiency associated forms. The endemic form is found in tropical and malaria endemic regions like Ghana and commonly presents as a jaw swelling with loosening of the associated teeth. In Ghana, it is the commonest childhood malignancy. It has a peak age incidence at 4-7 years with a male preponderance.CAUSESOften unknownAssociated aetiological agentsChronic antigenic stimulation by Helicobacter pylori infection in gastric lymphomaViruses e.g. herpes virus 8, epstein-barr virus, HTLV-1Chemicals e.g. pesticides, herbicidesWood dustSYMPTOMSLymph node swelling which may wax and waneJaw swelling (in Burkitts)FeverNight sweatsWeight lossEasy fatiguabilityAbdominal distension, intestinal obstruction (in abdominal lymphomas)SIGNSFirm, rubbery, non-tender lymph nodesSplenomegalySuperior vena cava syndrome (if bulky mediastinal masses are present)Pallor (if marrow has been involved)INVESTIGATIONSLymph node biopsy (of a significantly enlarged node)Fine needle aspiration (in Burkitts)FBC and blood film commentChest X-ray, abdominal USG, CT scan when necessaryBone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsyTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo provide a cureTo provide supportive treatment (pain relief, transfusion support, treat infections,counselling)Non-pharmacological treatmentEnsure good hydrationCounselling and educationPharmacological treatmentA.

    Malnutrition


  Malnutrition occurs when there is a deficiency in intake of essential nutrients (i.e. proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins and minerals). It is most commonly seen in children less than five years, particularly after weaning. Malnutrition reduces the individual's ability to fight disease and infection thereby increasing the likelihood of the patient presenting with diarrhoea, vomiting, fever, worm infestation, pneumonia, tuberculosis, otitis media, urinary tract infection etc. In adults, malnutrition frequently occurs in association with chronic alcoholism.
  
  Protein energy malnutrition (PEM), when severe, presents in different forms such as marasmus, kwashiorkor or marasmic-kwashiokor. 
  
  Birth-spacing, through family planning, as well as exclusive breast- feeding for up to 6 months, followed by Introduction of a weaning diet at 6 months and continuation with complimentary foods for up to 2 years, may be helpful measures in preventing malnutrition in young children. Encouraging a balanced diet for the family, including pregnant and lactating women, and nutrition education in schools and villages may help reduce the prevalence of malnutrition in the community.

The hot swollen joint is a common presentation and has extensive differential diagnosis. Some of the most serious causes are septic arthritis (with a case fatality of 11%) and acute leukemia in children. Late diagnosis and poor treatment leads to joint damage and death.The commonest affected joint is the big toe, typically due to gout and can be diagnosed on clinical grounds. Patients with a short history of a hot, swollen and tender joint (or joints) with restriction of movement should be regarded as having septic arthritis until proven otherwise. If clinical suspicion is high, then it is imperative to treat as septic arthritis even in the absence of fever.CAUSESSeptic arthritisReactive arthritisMonoarticular presentation of polyarthritisInflammatory arthritisGout or crystal arthritisHaemarthrosisTraumaBursitis/cellulitisLeukaemia (in children)HaemophiliaSYMPTOMSFeverJoint swelling (monoarthritis)Joint painLimited mobility of affected jointsSIGNSHot swollen native jointFeverJoint tendernessINVESTIGATIONSFBC, ESRBlood cultureBlood film commentC-reactive protein (CRP)Serum uric acid levelBUE and creatinineLiver function testsSynovial fluid aspirate for microscopy and cultureX-ray of affected jointMRI of the affected jointUltrasonography to aid diagnostic aspirationTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo reduce painTo reduce swelling and stiffnessTo prevent deformitiesTo delay disease progression and long-term complicationsNon-pharmacological treatmentRest of affected joints using bedrest, splintsPhysiotherapyJoint aspirationPharmacological treatmentA.

MeaslesMeasles is an acute infectious disease, which usually occurs in children between 6 months and 3 years who have not been immunised, or completed the full immunisation schedule. It is prevented by 2 doses of measles vaccination at 9 and 18 months. The condition is very infectious from up to 7 days before, to 5 days after, appearance of the rash.Complications include otitis media, with or without deafness, bronchopneumonia, croup, diarrhoea, vitamin A deficiency leading to xerophthalmia and blindness, malnutrition and activation of latent tuberculosis. Seriously ill measles patients requiring admission should be isolated. There is no specific treatment for measles. Antibiotics are not required, except for some specific complications.Measles diagnosis is mainly clinical. The disease is now uncommon because of immunisation. However, high immunisation coverage needs to be maintained to keep the disease under control. Report all cases to the District Disease Control 0fficer for appropriate action.CAUSE • Measles virusSYMPTOMS • Runny nose • Cough • Red eyes • Sore mouth • High fever, present before the rash appears • Rash - starts on face and neck • Diarrhoea • Child is generally miserableSIGNS • Fever • Conjunctivitis • Koplik spots (white grain-like spots on the buccal mucosa 2 days before rash) • Rash - itchy, generalised maculo-papularINVESTIGATIONS • Usually none • Measles immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody assay if requiredTreatment objectives • To relieve symptoms • To maintain good nutrition • To prevent and treat complicationsNon-pharmacological treatment • Tepid sponging for fever • Encourage oral hygiene with frequent saline mouth wash • Continue feeding with soft high calorie foods • Wash eyes with clean water • Discourage use of harsh items on skinPharmacological treatmentA.

MEDICINES AND THE KIDNEYMedicines can lead to renal damage in a number of different ways and examples are given below. In the wrong circumstances life-saving medicines can do more harm than good. Doctors, pharmacists and nurses can help their patients by checking their treatment charts in hospital or at the outpatients department. The medicines listed below may cause renal impairment and must therefore be stopped or not prescribed in patients with deteriorating renal function. All medicines in this table should be dosed based on kidney function (estimated GFR). Avoid concomitant use of nephrotoxic medications and diuretics. Monitor renal function before and during treatment. Patient-related risk factors for all these medicines include age, pre-existing chronic kidney disease, volume depletion, and concurrent use of nephrotoxic medicines .





    
    
    

Prescribing for older patients presents unique challenges. Many medications need to be used with special caution because of age-related changes in the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the drug as well as the physiologic effects of the drug. In particular, physiologic changes in body composition, renal and hepatic functions play vital roles in determining changes in drug levels and the risk of adverse drug events in the elderly.There is also the issue of multi-morbidity in the elderly, which leads to the prescribing of multiple medications. The more medications prescribed for an elderly person, the higher the risk of adverse effects and other drug interactions.The 'Beers criteria' (The American Geriatrics Society 2012 Beers Criteria Update Expert Panel) gives a list of medications considered inappropriate for older patients; either because of ineffectiveness or high risk for adverse events.CAUSES OF ADVERSE DRUG EVENTSPolypharmacyUse of inappropriate medicationsUnderutilization of appropriate medicationTransitions in care settingsMANAGEMENTTreatment objectivesPrevent Adverse Drug Events (ADE)Preventive measuresEducation on drug use for the elderly and their families or caregiversProper drug history taking by the healthcare providerQuality measures of drug prescribingAvoidance of inappropriate medicationsAppropriate use of indicated medications Monitoring for side effects and drug levelsAvoidance of drug-drug and drug-food interactionsInvolvement of the patient/family and integration of patient valuesMaintenance of an accurate list of all medications that a patient is currently usingPeriodic 'polythene bag check-ups'; i.e. instruct patients to bring all  pill bottles and containers on each medical visit (including empty packets and containers); these should be checked against the medication listPatients should be made aware of potential drug confusions i.e. sound-alike names, look-alike pills, and combination medicationsInform patients of both generic and brand names, including spelling, as well as the reasons for taking their medicationsMedicine organisers prepared by the pharmacist, can also be helpful in ensuring that patients take their medications correctly Medication Question ChecklistIs there a clear indication for this medication?Is it working?Are there side effects?Is the patient taking the medication routinely?Does the medication need lab monitoring?Is it still needed?

MENOPAUSEMenopause refers to the point in time when permanent cessation of menstruation occurs due to loss of ovarian function. The cessation    of menses is preceded by a peri-menopausal phase during which there may be menstrual irregularity. The age at onset is usually between 45 and 55 years. A woman is considered to be menopausal if there has not been menstruation for a period of at least 12 months in the absence    of pregnancy. Menopause may be associated with physical, emotional, and psychological upheaval of varying intensity in some women. Sixty percent of menopausal women however have mild symptoms or are asymptomatic. The risk of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease increase after the menopause.CAUSESA natural life event due to the ageing of the individualSurgical removal of the ovaries (bilateral oophorectomy)Pelvic irradiationPremature ovarian failurePituitary damage from primary post-partum haemorrhage (Sheehan's syndrome)Cytotoxic (anticancer) therapySYMPTOMSHot flushes(heat or burning in the face, neck and chest with resultant sweating)The flushes may be associated withPalpitationsFaintnessDizzinessFatigueWeaknessEmotional and psychological problems include:Mood changesDepressionAnxietyNervousnessIrritabilityLoss of libidoVaginal dryness and dyspareuniaSymptoms due to atrophic changes in the genital tract:Increased frequency of micturition and dysuria.Stress incontinence (urinary incontinence with coughing or straining)SIGNSUsually noneSerum LH, FSH, OestradiolRoutine investigations e.g. FBC, blood glucose, lipid profileUrine or blood pregnancy tests (to exclude pregnancy)TREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo control bothersome symptoms e.g. severe hot flushes, atrophic vaginitis and recurrent cystitisTo prevent cardiovascular morbidityTo prevent osteoporosis especially in individuals with premature menopauseNon-pharmacological treatmentCounselling and reassuranceEncourage active lifestyles, healthy diet, exercise and regular physical checkups for common medical problemsPharmacological treatmentHormone Replacement Therapy(HRT) for women with intact uterus1st Line Treatment Evidence Rating: [A]Combined conjugated oestrogens and progestogen, oral,Tablets each containing conjugated oestrogens-625 micrograms including 12 tablets containing norgestrel-150 micrograms) One tablet dailyOrConjugated oestrogen and norgestrel tablet, oral, (625 microgram and 150 microgram)  1 tablet daily on days 17-28 of each 28-day treatment cycle;Hormone Replacement Therapy(HRT) for women with previous hysterectomyEvidence Rating: [A]Conjugated oestrogens, oral, 625 microgram dailyFor relief of vaginal symptoms onlyEvidence Rating: [A]Oestrogen cream, vaginal, apply topicallyREFERRAL CRITERIARefer cases with osteoporosis or severe unremitting symptoms to the specialist.





    
    
    

Mouth ulcers are generally due to infection (bacterial, viral or fungal), neutropaenia, malignancy-related or trauma. The common ones are apthous and viral ulcers.APTHOUS ULCERSApthous ulcer is a recurrent ulcer of non-viral origin that occurs on the movable surfaces of the oral cavity. Size is variable but may have a rim of erythema with yellowish base, and later becoming a greyish hue. They are classified into minor, major or herpetiform on clinical presentation. The minor is < 1 cm, and the major 1-3 cm in diameter. The herpetiform comes in multiple crops of 1-3 cm. Though the cause is unknown, systemic conditions associated with apthous ulcer include Behcet's syndrome, HIV, Vitamin deficiency states (vitamin B group, folic acid).Herpetiform ulcers are a crop of oral apthous ulcers resembling oral viral ulcers.Behcet's disease is a more severe and generalised form involving the eye, skin and genitalia.CAUSESUnknownSYMPTOMSTingling on the oral mucosa (prodromal phase)Painful ulcerSIGNSCrater-like soft tissue ulcer with a yellowish-grey floorTendernessINVESTIGATIONSNilTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo control painTo treat ulcerTo control stressTo prevent secondary infectionNon-pharmacological treatmentProper oral hygeineRelaxationPharmacological treatmentA.

Neonatal conjunctivitis or ophthalmia neonatorum is an acute purulent conjunctivitis during the first month of life. It is usually contracted from infected genital secretions of the mother.Cleaning of the neonate's eyes immediately after birth and the application of 1% tetracycline ointment into the eyes, is effective in preventing the condition.

Neonatal hypoglycaemia refers to a random blood glucose level below 2.6 mmol/L in the newborn.As the clinical signs may be variable, or indeed absent, for small or sick babies or infants of diabetic mothers the random blood glucose level should be checked every three hours for the first 24 hours until it stays above 3.5 mmol/L for a further 24 hours.Neonatal hypoglycaemia may result in death if not promptly treated and should therefore be managed as soon as suspected. Successful treatment results in prompt response. To prevent hypoglycaemia, breastfeeding should be encouraged soon after birth. If the neonate is unable to suck, a nasogastric tube may be passed and expressed breast milk given. If enteral feeds are contraindicated, intravenous fluids should be started immediately.CAUSESPrematurityIntra uterine growth retardationBaby born to a diabetic motherInfectionAsphyxiaSYMPTOMSIrritability and restlessnessTremorsSweatingSeizuresLethargySIGNSSweatingTremorTachycardiaSeizuresUnconsciousnessINVESTIGATIONSRandom blood glucose (RBSUsing bed-side glucose meterCheck within 2 hours after birth and at regular 3 hourly intervals in infants at riskOther investigations depend on the suspected underlying causeTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo maintain blood glucose levels within normal limitsTo identify and treat underlying cause of hypoglycaemiaTo prevent complications e.g. brain damageNon-pharmacological treatmentBlood glucose monitoring ½ to 2 hourly in hypoglycaemic infants until normal levels attainedPharmacological treatmentEvidence Rating: [A]A.

Jaundice in the neonate may be visible when the serum bilirubin level exceeds 100 micromol/L. Neonatal jaundice is important because of the consequences of hyperbilirubinaema on the brain of the newborn. This condition is called kernicterus (bilirubin encephalopathy) and may cause death. Infants who survive may be handicapped with cerebral palsy, and associated deafness, mental retardation and motor incoordination.Approximately 80% of newborns will be jaundiced in the first week of life and most of this is physiological. This occurs on day 3 and lasts up to 10 days. This jaundice is mild and the baby remains healthy.Jaundice in the neonate is likely to be pathological if it is present within the first day of life; or conjugated (direct) bilirubin is more than 40 micromol/L; or total bilirubin is more than 170 micromol/L in preterm and more than 260 micromol/L in the term infant; or the neonate is significantly jaundiced beyond 14 days or has jaundice with fever.Exchange transfusion is the definitive treatment for hyperbilirubinaemia that has reached the level where kernicterus may occur.CAUSESPhysiologicalHaemolysis - Rhesus, AB0 incompatibility, G6PD deficiencyBlood extravasation - cephalhaematoma, subgaleal haematomaSepsisCongenital infectionsLiver diseaseMetabolic disorders - galactosemia, hypothyroidismEnhanced extra hepatic circulation - GIT obstruction, inadequate feedingCongenital defects of bilirubin metabolismBreast milk related jaundiceSYMPTOMSYellow eyesYellow skin, hands and feetPale stools (biliary atresia likely)SIGNSJaundiceYellow pigment in skinYellow palms +/- yellow soles of feetPale stools (biliary atresia likely)INVESTIGATIONSTotal and direct serum bilirubin concentrationOther investigations as below, dependent on age at presentation andsuspected cause:Early onset (within first 24 hours of birth)Blood group and rhesus (Rh) group of both infant and motherDirect Coombs test, Indirect Coombs test, FBC, G6PDBlood film for red cell anomalies, malaria parasitesCultures of blood, urine, and spinal fluid may be indicated by the history, physical examination or initial laboratory findingsProlonged jaundice (after 14 days)Liver Function testsThyroid Function testsUrine for reducing substancesUrine R/E and C/STORCH (congenital infections) screenHep BAbdominal ultrasound scan (exclude biliary atresia)TREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo prevent kernicterus (bilirubin encephalopathy)To detect and treat underlying causeNon-pharmacological treatmentPhototherapy (See note below on 'Phototherapy')Exchange blood transfusion (See note below on 'Exchange transfusion')Box 6-1: PhototherapyPhototherapy is started if:Jaundice is visible on day 1Jaundice involves palms and soles of feetJaundice in prematurityAfter day 2, measured level of unconjugated bilirubin is more than 170 mi- cromol/L in preterm or more than 260 micromol/L in term neonate.A phototherapy unit with blue fluorescent tube lights is preferred. If unavail-able, white fluorescent tubes may be used. The baby's eyes must be covered but should be examined daily for any infection. Continue breastfeeding during this time. Ensure adequate fluid intake. Prevent hypothermia or hyperthermia. Phototherapy should be continued till unconjugated bilirubin levels remain be- low phototherapy levels for at least 24 hours.Box 6-2: Exchange transfusionUse warm blood (37°C), cross-matched against maternal and infant serum (160 ml/kg over 2-3 hours). Monitor heart rate, respiratory rate, bilirubin and blood glucose levels during the procedure. Further exchanges may be needed if the bilirubin level continues to rise. Stop the exchange transfusion if the heart rate fluctuates by more than 20 beats/minute.Lower levels of bilirubin than stated above should be considered for intervention by phototherapy or exchange transfusion in the following cases: sick or low birth weight babies, or following asphyxia, prolonged hypoxemia, acidosis and sepsis.Since there is no exact test to determine the risk of kernicterus, and hence the level at which exchange transfusion is necessary, the following rule of thumb has proved useful as a guide;Serum bilirubin of more than 340 micromol/L in term infant more than 2 kgIn newborns weighing less than 2 kg, serum bilirubin exceeding the follow- ing would require exchange transfusion< 1 kg - 170 micromol/L1-2 kg - 250 micromol/LCord Hb < 12 g/dL or cord bilirubin > 80 micromol/LRapid progression of anaemia in presence of resolving jaundiceHydrops foetalis (requires immediate exchange transfusion with packed cellsPharmacological treatmentA.

Open fractures imply communication of the fracture haematoma with an epithelial surface like skin, bowel mucosa, bladder mucosa etc. The main problem here is infection, and therefore, every effort should be made to prevent it. In some cases, the degree of bone loss may warrant amputation. Exclude a neurological deficit especially when the injury is extensive. It is prudent to take a photograph of the affected part(s) for documentation and medico-legal purposes.Patients should never be sent for imaging unless haemodynamically stable.CAUSESRoad traffic accidentsDomestic violenceAssaultsWork place injuriesFall from a heightSYMPTOMSLocalised painSwellingBleedingExposed bone, muscle and fasciaInability to move the partSIGNSSwellingDeformityBloodLaceration over the fractureCrepitusShock if there has been significant blood lossConfusion or unconsciousness if there is shock or associated head injuryINVESTIGATIONSHaemoglobinBlood for grouping and cross matchingX-rays of suspected part to include joints above and belowTrauma series X-rays (Cervical spine, Chest and Pelvis) if injury is deemed severe or if patient is confused or unconsciousCT scan (for fractures involving the following areas):HeadSpinePelvisFractures around jointsCT angiograms (if significant vascular injury is suspected)MRI (to assess spinal cord and soft tissue injuries of the knee)Abdominal USG (if intra-abdominal injury is suspected)TREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo resuscitate the patient (save a life first) - ATLS protocol (ABCDE)To save the affected limb(s) (save a limb next)To prevent and eradicate infectionTo restore function of the affected limb(s)Non-pharmacological treatmentRemove all foreign bodiesCover with sterile dressingSplinting of affected limb(s)P.O.P. backslabPrefabricated splintsCustomized splintElevation of affected limb(s)Early range of motion physiotherapyKeep nil per os until final decision about management has been made.Surgical - under general anaesthesiaIrrigationDebridementExternal fixation or backslabPharmacological treatmentA.

Overweight and obesity are associated with conditions that cause premature ill-health and death, such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure (hypertension), heart disease and stroke.  0ther  conditions such as gout, obstructive sleep apnoea, gallstones, heartburn, arthritis, skin infections as well as various cancers have been linked to excess body weight. They also increase the risk of developing deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism as well as elevated blood cholesterol, which increases the risk for heart attacks and strokes.Weight reduction often corrects, or helps to control, these associated conditions. 0ccasionally rapid weight gain may be associated with an underlying endocrine condition such as hypothyroidism and Cushing's syndrome.CAUSESExcess intake of caloriesLack of regular physical activitySecondary causes e.g. hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndromeSYMPTOMSUsually noneSIGNSBody Mass Index (BMI) increased18.5-24.9 kg/m2 - Ideal weight25.0-29.9 kg/m2 - 0verweight30.0-34.9 kg/m2 - 0bese> 35.0 kg/m2  - Severely obeseMid-abdominal (waist) girth, taken roughly at the level of the umbilicus, increasedAdult females:< 80 cm or 32 inchesIdeal abdominal girth80 - 88 cm or 32-35 inchesOverweight>88 cm or 35 inchesObeseAdult males:< 94 cm or 37 inchesIdeal abdominal girth94 - 102 cm or 37 - 40 inchesOverweight>102 cm or 40 inchesObeseINVESTIGATIONSBlood glucoseBlood lipid profileBlood uric acidECGTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo ensure a loss of 10% of the initial body weight, within 6 months, at a rate of no more than 2-4 kg per monthTo attain the ideal BMI and/or abdominal girthTo sustain the weight reduction achievedNon-pharmacological treatmentWeight reduction diet, preferably under the supervision of a dieticianRegular physical activity comprising 30 minutes brisk walking, or equivalent activity, for a minimum of 3 days per week if there are no contraindicationsAppropriate management of associated co-morbid disordersPharmacological treatmentApproved anti-obesity treatments are available but should only be given under specialist guidanceREFERRAL CRITERIAIndividuals with severe and morbid obesity may require referral to a physician specialist and occasionally may need psychological counselling.

PertussisThis is a highly contagious bacterial respiratory tract infection common in children and adults. The incubation period is 7-21 days.Complications include subconjunctival haemorrhage, otitis media, apnoea, pneumonia, bronchiectasis, activation of latent tuberculosis, dehydration, fever, convulsions, rectal prolapse, and malnutrition. Admit to hospital when complications are present.Pertussis can be prevented by the "five-in-one" Immunisation recommended for all children (See section on 'Immunisation').In the event of a child developing pertussis before immunisation, the "five in one" vaccine should still be given to protect against the four other diseases.During epidemics, or when there is a clear history of contact in a child with catarrh, appropriate antibiotics may help reduce the period of infectivity and transmission. All cases should be reported to the District Disease Control Officer.CAUSE • Bordetella pertussisSYMPTOMSCatarrhal Phase: Initial 1-2 weeks • Low grade fever • Nasal discharge • Mild coughParoxysmal phase: within the following 6-10 weeks • Episodes of violent repetitive cough ending with inspiratory whoop or vomiting (whoop may be absent in babies and adults)Recovery (convalescent) phase: next 2-3 weeks • Gradual reduction in bouts of coughingSIGNS • Apnoea (long pause in breathing) common in babies • CyanosisINVESTIGATIONS • FBC - high total lymphocyte count • Chest X-ray (to exclude other causes of chronic cough)TREATMENTTreatment objectives • To reduce transmission • To prevent complicationsNon-pharmacological treatment • Feed frequently between coughing spasms • Encourage adequate oral fluid intakePharmacological treatmentA.

This is an infection of the throat and tonsils. Most sore throats are due to viral infections and should NOT be treated with antibiotics as they subside within 3 to 5 days. However, it is important to diagnose streptococcal pharyngitis since it may give rise to abscesses in the throat (retropharyngeal and peritonsillar abscess) as well as complications that involve organs like the kidneys and the heart.

Plasma cell myeloma (previously referred to as multiple myeloma), is cancer affecting the plasma cells in the bone marrow. These abnormal plasma cells occur in increased numbers and produce abnormal non- functional immunoglobulins leading to impaired ability to fight infections in the patient affected, hyperviscosity and renal failure. In the bone marrow the increased plasma cells result in a reduction in normal blood cell production and erosion of bone with resultant peripheral blood cytopaenias, osteolytic lesions, pathological fractures and hypercalcaemia. The disease is commonest in the sixth decade and rare below the age of 40 years.CAUSESUnknownPotential precipitants:Chemicals e.g. dioxins, formaldehyde, and nitrobenzene found in solvents and cleaning agentsIonizing radiationViruses e.g. Herpes Virus 8, Epstein-Barr, HIV, Hepatitis VirusSYMPTOMSBone painEasy fatiguabilityExcessive weaknessRecurrent infectionsBony swellingsSIGNSPallorFeverDehydrationBony lumpsParaplegiaParesisRenal ImpairmentUnprovoked fracturesINVESTIGATIONSFBC and blood film commentESRBlood urea, electrolytes, creatininePlasma calcium levelsSerum uric acidBone marrow aspirateSkeletal survey including skull X-raySerum protein levelsSerum protein electrophoresisUrine Bence Jones proteinTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo reduce the number of abnormal plasma cells to normal and reduce their rate of increaseTo treat anaemiaTo reduce bone painTo manage pathological fractureTo improve or maintain good bone mineral densityTo treat infectionsTo prevent and treat renal complicationsNon-pharmacological treatmentPatients should drink at least 3 litres of fluid each day throughout the course of their diseasePhysiotherapyOrthopaedic supportsPharmacological treatmentA.

Pneumococcal DiseasePneumococcal disease presents more commonly as non-invasive disease in the form of non-bacteraemic pneumonia, middle-ear infections, sinusitis, or bronchitis. However, it may also manifest as Invasive Pneumococcal Diseases (IPD) in the form of pneumonia with empyema and/or bacteraemia or meningitis as a result of haematogenic spread. In developing countries, non-bacteraemic pneumonia causes the majority of pneumococcal deaths. Ninety distinct serotypes have been identified.Pneumococcal disease is effectively prevented with Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV) at 6,10 and 14 weeks for infants. Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine (PPSV23) is recommended for persons older than 2 years with underlying medical conditions such as Sickle Cell Disease. Adults with immunocompromising conditions, functional or anatomic asplenia, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, or cochlear implants should receive PCV13 followed by PPSV23.CAUSES • Streptococcus pneumoniaeSYMPTOMS•Fever• Other symptoms associated with pneumonia, otitis media, meningitis, septicaemiaSIGNS• Please refer to signs and symptoms of the specific diseases in other sectionsINVESTIGATIONS• Culture and sensitivity of appropriate body fluids (e.g. pus from the ear in suppurative otitis media, cerebrospinal fluid in meningitis, pleural aspirate in empyema, blood).

PneumoniaPneumonia is an infection of the lung tissue caused by various bacteria, viruses or fungi. Identification of the causative organism and drug sensitivity testing is the key to correct treatment. However, because of the serious nature of the infection, antibiotic treatment should be started immediately based on knowledge of the most probable causative organism and the antibiotics used for its treatment. Local knowledge of drug resistance patterns are also taken into account. Treatment may be maintained or changed based on culture results and assessment of the patient's response to initial treatment. In the event that the cultures of blood or sputum prove negative, empiric treatment is continued with clinical response as a guide. The severity of the illness is a key factor in the decision for admission, and the choice of first or second-line treatment.

Oesophageal pain is usually burning in quality and tends to be localised behind the sternum. Oesophageal pain may be associated with difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia). Dysphagia to water suggests achalasia, while that to solids and not water suggests mechanical obstruction by tumour or stricture. It may sometimes be confused with other causes of chest pain (See section on 'Chest Pain').CAUSES•  Irritation of the oesophageal mucosa by reflux of the acidic contents of the stomach (Gastro-oesophageal Reflux Disease (GORD)•  Oesophageal candidiasis•  Hiatus hernia•  Achalasia•  Spasm of the oesophageal muscle in response to obstruction.•  Oesophageal tumoursSYMPTOMS•  Retrosternal chest pain worsened by swallowing (pain worse on lying flat may suggest GORD)•  Regurgitation of ingested material•  Difficulty in swallowingSIGNS•  Usually none•  Patient may be obese or severely underweight in the case of G0RD•  Severe weight loss may suggest tumour or candidiasis from immunesuppression•  There may be oral candidiasis in the case of oesophageal candidiasisINVESTIGATIONS•  Barium swallow•  Oesophago-gastroduodenoscopy (upper GI endoscopy)•  Oesophageal manometry when achalasia is suspectedTREATMENTTreatment objectives•  To relieve pain•  To treat identified causeNon-pharmacological treatment•  Bland foods and milk (may sometimes relieve the pain)Pharmacological treatmentA.

PoliomyelitisPoliomyelitis is a viral disease, which is spread by faecal-oral or oral- to-oral transmission. Insanitary disposal of excreta and use of unsafe drinking water contribute to the spread. The disease is characterised by varying degrees of acute flaccid paralysis, which commonly persists.Paralysis commonly affects one lower limb but any group of skeletal muscles, including the muscles of respiration and bulbar cells in the brain may be affected.Poliomyelitis is commonly acquired in childhood. The infection is often sub-clinical and may only appear as a mild flu-like illness. 0nly few cases progress to develop paralysis. However, injections during periods of the febrile illness are associated with an increased incidence of paralytic poliomyelitis.Poliomyelitis is preventable by Immunisation. Prevention is almost certain if 4 doses of oral polio vaccine are given as in the EPI schedule. Rarely Vaccine-Associated Paralytic Poliomyelitis (VAPP) may occur in recipients of oral polio vaccines and their unimmunised contacts. This is usually associated with polio virus type 2.Note 5-1All cases of poliomyelitis should be reported to the District Disease Control Officer for follow-up.CAUSES • Poliovirus serotypes 1, 2 or 3SYMPTOMS • Fever • Headache • Sore throat • Muscle pain • Flaccid paralysisSIGNS • Acute flaccid paralysis of affected muscles • Diminished or absent muscle reflexesINVESTIGATIONS • Two fresh stool samples taken 24-48 hours apart (to be sent on ice to the Regional Public Health Reference Laboratory for confirmation)TREATMENTTreatment objectives • To provide supportive care till patient recovers from acute illness • To avoid or limit the extent of paralysis • To provide rehabilitation in paralytic casesNon-pharmacological treatment • Bed rest • Avoid injections during febrile illness in children • Physiotherapy • Provision of appropriate appliances to aid mobilityPharmacological treatment • No specific antiviral treatmentREFERRAL CRITERIARefer all patients with difficulty in breathing and swallowing for hospital admission.





    
    
    

POSTERIOR URETHRAL VALVESThese valves or folds of tissue are congenital obstructing membranes within the lumen of the urethra. It affects between 1 in 5,000 - 8,000 males. It is the commonest cause of congenital bladder outlet obstruction. They obstruct urinary outflow from the bladder but permit easy urethral catheterization. Because the obstruction starts in-utero, secondary changes in the bladder and upper urinary tract are advanced at birth.Some patients may be born with severe renal impairment or this may develop soon after birth if recognition is delayed. Most patients present as neonates or infants. Occasionally presentation is late in childhood. All male newborn babies should be closely watched to ensure good stream of urine. Prenatal diagnosis is possible using ultrasound.CAUSESCongenital valves or folds within the lumen of the posterior urethraSYMPTOMSPoor urinary streamCrying while voidingStraining to void with dribbling of urineIntermittent streamFailure to thriveFeverPoor feedingAbdominal distensionSIGNSVoiding dysfunctionPalpable bladder and kidneysRespiratory distressSigns of sepsis e.g. FeverAzotaemia/uraemiaPoor physical growth/growth retardationINVESTIGATIONSFBCBlood urea, electrolytes and creatinineUrinalysisUrine cultureAbdominal ultrasoundMicturating cysto-urethrogramTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo prevent and treat renal failureTo remove obstructing valvesNon-pharmacological treatmentPrompt bladder decompression and continuous drainage to protect  the upper tract from back pressure damage.

POST-PARTUM HAEMORRHAGE
 
Post-partum haemorrhage may be primary or secondary. Primary postpartum haemorrhage refers to bleeding of more than 500 ml from the genital tract within the first twenty-four hours of delivery or any amount of blood loss that result in haemodynamic compromise of the patient. It usually occurs during or immediately after the third stage of labour. Secondary post-partum haemorrhage is defined as excessive vaginal bleeding occurring from twenty-four hours to six weeks after delivery.The bleeding may occur with the placenta retained or after its expulsion from the uterus. Postpartum haemorrhage becomes life threatening if the mother is already anaemic. Blood loss of more than 500 ml may lead to shock.
CAUSES

Uterine atony (70-90% of cases)
Retention of all or part of placental tissue within the uterine cavity
Infection within the uterine cavity (endo-myometritis)
Genital tract trauma
Clotting disorders

SYMPTOMS

Excessive or prolonged vaginal bleeding after delivery
Lower abdominal pains

SIGNS
Active bleeding from the genital tract

Conjunctival pallor
Rapid pulse
Blood pressure may be low or normal
Deterioration of maternal levels of consciousness
Flabby poorly contracted uterus
Obvious tears in birth canal and/or perineum
Obvious retained placenta
Suprapubic tenderness

INVESTIGATIONS

FBC, sickling status
Bedside clotting test
Blood grouping and cross-matching
Ultrasound scan (if patient is stable to check for retained placenta tissue)

TREATMENT
Treatment objectives

To identify the cause and stop bleeding as quickly as possible
To correct hypotension
To correct resulting anaemia

Non-pharmacological treatment
Due to uterine atony (70-90% of cases), with no placental retention

Massage fundus of uterus to stimulate contraction
Encourage woman to empty bladder or pass a urethral catheter to empty the bladder and monitor urine output
Bimanual compression of the uterus and balloon tamponade if uterus fails to contract with massage

Due to retained placenta

Attempt removal of the placenta by controlled cord traction as soon as a contraction is felt. If not successful await the next contraction and repeat the procedure
If the placenta cannot be expelled in this fashion, manual removal

under anaesthesia is indicated

If the placenta has been delivered and is incomplete, exploration the uterus and manual removal under anaesthesia is indicated
If the facilities for manual removal of placenta under anaesthesia are not immediately available refer to hospital

Bleeding with uterus well contracted and placenta completely delivered

Examine the patient in the lithotomy position with adequate analgesia and/or anaesthesia, good lighting to identify and suture perineal, vaginal and cervical tears
If the tear(s) extends into the uterine body, effective suturing cannot

be performed and repair will involve a laparotomy

For ruptured uterus, repair or hysterectomy is required

Bleeding associated with coagulopathy

Bedside clotting test - 5 ml of blood placed in a 10 ml round bottomed glass tube should clot in 6 minutes

PRE-ECLAMPSIA
Pre-eclampsia is a disease specifically associated with pregnancy. It usually occurs in the second half of pregnancy and it is characterized by hypertension and proteinuria. The presence of pedal oedema or excessive weight gain may also be a feature of pre-eclampsia. Blood pressure monitoring every 4 hours together with daily weighing of the patient are essential in the management of pre-eclampsia alongside the recommended investigations. While blood pressure reduction is essential, lowering the blood pressure below 140/90mmHg may cause foetal distress and should be avoided.
CAUSES
The cause is unknown but the disease is more commonly associated with the following:

Primigravidae
Maternal age (women < 18 or > 35 years)
Multiple pregnancies
Hydatidiform mole
Medical disorders e.g. polycystic ovaries, chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, kidney disorders
First pregnancy with a new partner
Previous history of pre-eclampsia
Family history of pre-eclampsia

SYMPTOMS

Patients with pre-eclampsia are often asymptomatic
Swollen feet

SIGNS
Mild cases
Systolic blood pressure between 140 and 159 mmHg Diastolic blood pressure between 90 and 109 mmHg Proteinuria of 1+ or 2+

Pedal oedema

Severe cases

Systolic blood pressure 160 mmHg or higher
Diastolic blood pressure 110 mmHg or higher
Proteinuria of 3+ or 4+
Pedal or generalised oedema

INVESTIGATIONS

FBC
Serum Uric Acid
BUE and Creatinine
Urinalysis and culture
Liver function tests
Random blood glucose
Daily assessment of urine proteins
Ultrasound scan for close foetal growth monitoring

TREATMENT
Treatment objectives

To reduce elevated blood pressure, but not less than 140/90 mmHg
To prolong the pregnancy as much as possible to allow the foetus to grow and mature for delivery
To prevent foetal distress
To prevent or treat any complications that may arise
To prevent eclampsia

Non-pharmacological treatment

Admit for rest if possible
Encourage patients to lie on their sides to avoid supine hypotension

Pharmacological treatment

Mild pre-eclampsia

There is no need for drug treatment of the hypertension unless the BP rises above 150 mmHg systolic or 100 mmHg diastolic or the patient becomes symptomatic of imminent eclampsia (see below).
Evidence Rating: [B]

Methyldopa, oral, 250-500 mg 8-12 hourly (max. 2 g/day)

Or

Nifedipine retard, oral, 10-40 mg 12 hourly

Or

Nifedipine slow release, oral, 30-60 mg daily






    
    
    

PRETERM LABOUR IN PREMATURE DELIVERY
Preterm labour refers to labour occurring after 28 weeks but before 37 completed weeks resulting in premature delivery. The preterm newborn is at risk of death because all its body systems such as lungs, brain, digestive and immune systems are not fully developed. There is increased susceptibility to infection and impaired clotting mechanisms. The baby is also at risk of birth injuries such as cerebral haemorrhage because the fragile cranial bones do not provide sufficient protection for the brain. Some risk factors for preterm labour include young age of mothers, poor socio-economic class and smoking.
CAUSES

Maternal infections e.g. pyelonephritis, malaria
Incompetent cervix
Premature rupture of membranes
Multiple pregnancies
Abruptio placentae
Diabetes mellitus
Pre-eclampsia/eclampsia

SYMPTOMS

Regular and painful uterine contractions or abdominal pains
There may be a show

Treatment is best done in a hospital where the facilities can support the adequate care of the preterm neonate. Therefore, refer the mother if the clinic cannot adequately care for the immature neonate. It is better to transfer the foetus in-utero to the referral centre.





    
    
    

PRIAPISMThis refers to a spontaneous, prolonged, persistent, usually painful erection, which is unwanted and not associated with sexual desire and not relieved by coitus. Priapism is classified into three types namely: Low-flow or ischaemic (commonest), High-flow (non-ischaemic) and Stuttering Priapism. It is commonly seen as a prolongation of Nocturnal Penile Tumescence (NPT) or early morning erection. This is a well-known complication of sickle cell disease. Patients are usually shy and reluctant to come to the hospital due to stigmatisation. Late presentation is therefore common and herbal medicine applications and spiritual remedies may have been tried to relieve symptoms prior to being seen in hospital. Early reversal within 24-48 hours may reduce the high impotence complication rate of 50%. Although the occurrence is usually in adults, it may periodically occur in older children.CAUSESIdiopathic or unknown in 60% of casesDrugs e.g. marijuana and herbal concoctionsOther causes:LeukaemiaSickle cell disease and thalassaemiaPenile traumaSpinal cord injuryPelvic infectionsPelvic tumourIatrogenic e.g. Intracavernosal prostaglandin E1 for impotence, sildenafil citrate, psychotropics e.g. chlorpromazineSYMPTOMSPainful persistent erectionSIGNSErect, tender penisClinical signs of sickle cell diseaseINVESTIGATIONSFBC, blood film commentSickling status - Hb electrophoresisUrinalysis TREATMENT Treatment objectivesTo relieve painTo ensure early relief of penile congestionTo prevent complicationsNon-pharmacological treatmentEvidence Rating: [A]Maintain adequate hydrationWinter's ProcedureCorpora IrrigationSurgery: ShuntsPharmacological treatmentConservative managementEvidence Rating: [C]Sodium Chloride 0.9%, IV,Adults1 L 6 hourly and liberal oral fluidsChildren500 ml 6 hourly and liberal oral fluidsAndPethidine, IM,Adults100 mg 8 hourly if requiredChildren1 mg/kg (max. 50 mg) 8 hourly if requiredAndDiazepam,IV,Adult10 mg stat.

CARCINOMA OF PROSTATENinety-five per  cent  of these  tumours  are adenocarcinomas.  The majority of men affected are aged between 65 and 85 years. The incidence increases with age. It is recommended that every male, 40 years and above, should have annual screening by Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) tests and Digital Rectal Examination (DRE) since early detection is associated with better prognosis. The benefit or otherwise of screening should be discussed with patients. Patients with a family history of prostate cancer and should consider annual screening from 40 years and above with PSA and DRE. It is worth noting that not every hard prostate on DRE is malignant. Likewise a normal-feeling prostate does not exclude a malignancy. A prostatic biopsy is therefore necessary to establish a diagnosis.CAUSESAgeingFunctional testesFamily history of prostate cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancerRace (more common in blacks)High dietary fat intakeSYMPTOMSAsymptomatic: prostate cancer may be present without symptoms in the early stageLower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) and IPSSRetention of urineHaematuriaGeneral debility anorexia, weight loss, listlessnessBone pain (commonly in the waist or limbs)Paralysis in the lower limbs or inability to walkPathological FractureImpotenceHaemospermiaTenesmusSIGNSOn DRE clinical signs include;Hard prostate gland with an irregular surface and edgesObliterated median sulcusAdherent rectal mucosaAdvanced or metastatic disease:AnaemiaUraemiaWastingBone tendernessParaplegiaPathological fractureINVESTIGATIONSFBCBlood urea, electrolytes and creatinineProstate Specific Antigen (PSA)Liver function testsAbdominal and pelvic ultrasoundTransrectal Ultrasound (TRUS) of the prostate, if availableTransrectal needle biopsy of the prostateTRUS-guided or finger-guidedTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo relieve symptomsTo control complicationsTo achieve cure for early diseaseTo prevent local progression and metastasesNon-pharmacological treatmentUrethral catheterisation to relieve urinary retention where neededRadical prostatectomy or radiotherapy, under specialist care, for early diseaseSurgical castration (bilateral orchidectomy) for advanced diseasePharmacological treatmentEvidence Rating: [A]Pharmacological treatment of carcinoma of the prostate, which involves hormonal manipulation, which inhibits growth of the tumour by depriving it of androgens, is best carried out under specialist care.The common drugs used in advanced prostate cancer therapy are:AntiandrogensBicalutamide, oral, 50 mg daily (refer to specialist)OrFlutamide, oral, 250 mg 8 hourly(refer to specialist)OestrogenStilboestrol, oral, 2-5 mg daily (Avoid in clients with cardiovascular diseases), (refer to specialist) LHRH AnaloguesGoserelin, SC, preferably in the abdominal wall (refer to specialist)OrLeuprolide acetate, IM, (refer to specialist)AndBisphosphonates and Fentanyl patches(refer to specialist) REFERRAL CRITERIARefer all cases to a specialist centre for evaluation and management





    
    
    

PRURITUSPruritus or itching is an unpleasant sensation on the skin that provokes the desire to rub or scratch the area. Itching can cause discomfort and frustration. In severe cases it can lead to disturbed sleep, anxiety and depression. Constant scratching to obtain relief can damage the skin and reduce its effectiveness as a major protective barrier. Treatment of pruritus must address the underlying condition. Diagnosis therefore needs to be made for effective treatment.

This refers to attacks of synovitis induced by deposition of Calcium Pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals. Most patients are old females.It behaves like gout in many respects, but unlike gout, attacks persist longer and affect the knee most commonly.Common risk factors include trauma, surgery, severe illness, parathyroidectomy, pamidronate therapy.

Psychogenic seizures or pseudo seizures are non-epileptic seizures, which mimic epilepsy but actually have an underlying psychological cause. In patients with this form of disorder, there may be a history of physical, sexual or psychological abuse. The symptoms may be precipitated by stress and the signs are often variable and may include resistance to   eye opening upon examination. The diagnosis requires a high level of suspicion since it is often difficult to separate from epileptic seizures and may, in fact co-exist with epilepsy.SYMPTOMSRecurrent tonic clonic-like seizuresAttacks usually occur only when attention of other people can be attractedPatients hardly ever get injured, even when they fall (unlike in true seizures)Thrusting pelvic movements are common during "seizure" attacksTongue biting, if it occurs is usually at the tip of the tongue instead of the sides as in true seizuresMay have urinary incontinence as in normal seizuresINVESTIGATIONSSerum prolactinEEGTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo stop seizuresTo restore normalcyNon-pharmacological treatmentReassure parents, guardians etc.CounsellingPsychotherapyPharmacological treatmentAnti-epileptic medicines do not appear to have any beneficial effect on frequency of attacks REFERRAL CRITERIARefer all cases for evaluation by psychologist or psychiatrist.





    
    
    

Peptic ulcer may be duodenal or gastric. Duodenal ulcers are more common and occur more often in younger adults. Gastric ulcers usually occur after middle age. Gastric ulcers should be taken seriously because they may be malignant.Peptic ulcers may lead to life threatening complications of bleeding, perforation and gastric outlet obstruction.CAUSES•  Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection•  Excessive secretion of gastric acid•  Inadequate protection of the lining of the stomach and duodenum against digestion by acid and pepsin•  Medicines e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroidsSYMPTOMS•           Episodic abdominal pain (often aggravated by dietary indiscretions and lifestyle)•  May be a minor discomfort, gnawing, burning, dull ache or very severe pain•  Typically pain is in the epigastrium or right hypochondrium•  Occasionally high up behind the sternum or low down around the umbilicus•  In duodenal ulcer, pain typically comes on when the patient is hungry and may wake the patient up in the middle of the night.•  In gastric ulcer, it is typically worsened by food, and may be re- lieved by vomiting•  Is relieved by alkalis and food in duodenal ulcer•           Vomiting may occur in both duodenal and gastric ulcers. It is usually a complication in duodenal ulcer (gastric outlet obstruction) but may be self-induced in gastric ulcer to relieve painIn children•  Pain may be peri-umbilicalSIGNS•  There may be no abdominal signs•  Weight loss (sometimes in gastric ulcer)•  Weight gain (sometimes in duodenal ulcer)•  Tenderness - epigastrium, right hypochondrium or umbilical region INVESTIGATIONS•  Haemoglobin•  H. pylori stool antigen•  Oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (endoscopy)•  Barium meal (in the absence of endoscopy)•  Stool examination (to exclude intestinal parasites)TREATMENTTreatment objectives•  To relieve pain (dyspepsia) and reduce gastric acid secretion•  To eradicate H. pylori if present•  To promote healing of the ulcer•  To prevent recurrence of the ulcer•  To prevent and manage complicationsNon-pharmacological treatment•  Avoid alcohol and tobacco intake•  Avoid foods that aggravate the pain•  Allay anxiety and stress•  Surgical treatment: for chronic cases with severe periodic attacks, failed medical treatment and complications e.g. perforation, gastric outlet obstruction and haemorrhage)Pharmacological treatmentA.

Pulmonary Embolism(PE) results from thrombi, often from the deep veins of the lower limbs or pelvis, which are transported via the right heart into the pulmonary vasculature. Large emboli may cause obstruction to blood flow and result in life-threatening hypoxia and high mortality. PE should therefore be managed as a medical emergency.The risk factors and management for PE are similar to those for DVT. (See section on 'DVT').CAUSES(See section on 'DVT')SYMPTOMS • Dyspnoea • Pleuritic pain • Cough • Haemoptysis (due to pulmonary infarction) • Presyncope, syncopeor collapse (massivePE) • Unilateral swelling of a limbSIGNS • Tachypnoea • Tachycardia (may be regular or irregular) • Blood pressure - low/unrecordable (suggests massive PE), normalor high • Pleural effusion • Low oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry <90% • Pleural rub • Cyanosis • Unilaterally swollen calf or thigh of DVT

REACTIVE ERETHYMA AND BOLLUS REACTIONThese are immunologic reactions characterized by reddening with or without blistering of the skin and/or mucosa. The common types are erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). With all these conditions, there could be accompanying extensive denudation of skin with consequent fluid and electrolyte loss and a risk of secondary bacterial infection. All three conditions should be considered as emergencies requiring intensive care.Erythema multiforme presents as itchy, target-like, non-scaly lesions of the palms, soles, forearms and legs.Stevens-Johnson syndrome is characterized by erythema and blister formation, which additionally involves the mucous membranes (conjunctiva, mouth, genitals etc.).Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a generalized scalded type of skin reaction, often due to an allergic reaction to drugs. A similar reaction occurs in children termed staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, which is caused by Staphylococcus aureus.

Retinoblastoma is a congenital malignant tumour originating from the retina of the eye. This tumour may be hereditary, particularly the bilateral form which forms about 30% of cases. Most tumours however are sporadic (spontaneous mutation). This is the third commonest cancer seen amongst children in Ghana. Most children present before five  years of age. It rarely occurs in older children. The prognosis with early presentation is excellent with a 95% chance of long term cure. There is  a high rate of development of tumours of other organs later in life in the hereditary form.CAUSESGenetic (up to 40% of cases)Sporadic (in about 60% of cases)SYMPTOMSWhite, shiny spot (leukocoria) in the pupil, also known as the cat's eye reflex is usually the first symptom in most patientsSquint (strabismus)Visual lossProtruding eyeballRedness of the eyeSIGNSAbsent red reflexTumour in the retina on fundoscopyVitreous haemorrhage and retinal detachment on fundoscopyIncreased intraocular pressure (glaucoma)Orbital cellulitisINVESTIGATIONSUltrasound scan of orbitHead CT or MRI scanLumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid cytologyBone marrow aspirateTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo arrest the progression of the tumourTo prevent distant spread of tumourTo achieve long term cureTo provide adequate supportive and palliative care in advanceddiseaseNon-pharmacological treatmentEnucleation of the affected eye is curative in the early stagesProsthetic eye insertionLaser therapy for focal controlRadiotherapy for local spread of the tumourCounselling to help cope with psychological impact of the diseasePharmacological treatmentA.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease of unknown cause. An external trigger (e.g. cigarette smoking, infection, or trauma) triggers an autonomic reaction, leading to synovial hypertrophy and chronic joint inflammation along with the prospect for extra-articular manifestations. It is believed to occur in genetically susceptible individuals and more common in middle aged women.

Rotavirus is the most common cause of severe diarrhoea in young children. It accounts for more than a third of all hospitalizations of children less than 5 years. It occurs year round with peaks between the dry months (December - March).

Schizophrenia is probably the most severe and potentially  disabling form of mental illness in every community worldwide. It may present as an acute or chronic illness. The clinical features include characteristic 'positive' or 'negative' symptoms, deterioration in social, work or interpersonal relationships and continued evidence of disturbed behaviour for at least 6 months.The clinical features may be numerous and can change over time. Psychosis associated with substance abuse and mood disorders with psychotic features may mimic schizophrenia.For this illness, a few people may recover completely after an episode or two. Treatment must be started once symptoms are present. A definitive diagnosis and establishment of a treatment plan is best carried out by a psychiatrist. Treatment for acute episodes can be started by a psychiatrist and follow up treatment continued by most health care givers. Treatment must be for at least 18 months after remission of symptoms for a first episode. However, life long treatment is probably the best strategy to avoid recurrence.Side effects such as extra-pyramidal reactions (slowness, drooling, stiffness, tremors, rigidity, muscle spasms including tongue stickingout, neck bending, etc.) to antipsychotics may occur especially when administered at high doses. These adverse reactions can be prevented or managed with anticholinergic agents, which must be used sparingly as they may contribute to the development of another adverse event, called tardive dyskinesia, in the long term.

Scurvy is a multi-system disease, which may present with bony deformities and soft tissue scarring. It is caused by dietary deficiency of Vitamin-C (ascorbic acid). It is rare globally but seen in the low-middle income countries.

A seizure is a clinical event caused by a transient disturbance of brain function due to an abnormal paroxysmal neuronal discharge in   the brain. If these episodes are recurrent without an identifiable cause, they are commonly described as epilepsy.  The term status epilepticus   is used for repeated seizures, which occur without the patient regaining consciousness between attacks. (See section on 'Epilepsy and Status epilepticus').The clinical presentation depends on the part of the brain affected. Patients may sometimes describe the warning signals (termed a prodrome or aura), which they experienced before the event. A detailed description by a witness is key.General anaesthesia and ventilation may be required in severe cases and where high doses of anticonvulsants are required.CAUSESCongenital, prenatal or perinatal injuryFevers, especially in children aged 6 months to 6 years (febrile convulsion)Cerebral malariaInfections e.g. meningitis, TB, HIV, abscesses in the brainMetabolic causes: hypoglycaemia, hypocalcaemia, hyponatraemia, hyperosmolar diabetic state, uraemia, hepatic failureIdiopathic epilepsy (See section on 'Epilepsy')EclampsiaVascular diseases: hypertensive encephalopathy, stroke, myocardial infarctionSpace occupying lesions: tumour or malformations of the brainHead traumaDrugs and toxins: alcohol, antidepressants, metronidazole, drug and alcohol withdrawalDegenerative diseases e.g. dementiaPsychogenic: (See section on 'Psychogenic Seizures')SYMPTOMSLoss of consciousnessTongue bitingFoaming at the mouthIncontinence of stool and/or urineAura (may include a strange gut feeling, somatosensory manifestations - visual, olfactory, gustatory or auditory e.g. strange smells/flashing lights)Muscle twitching and movements which may be focal or generalizedAfter a seizure, the patient may be confused (post-ictal confusion) or may sleep for some time (post-ictal sleep)SIGNSA prodrome or aura with automatism (lip smacking, picking at items)Muscle twitching and movements which may be focal or generalizedPost-ictal sleepPost-ictal confusionTodd's paralysis (stroke-like weakness) may rarely occurExamine carefully for evidence of  neurological localizing  signs,  tongue laceration and evidence of trauma to the face or other parts of the bodyINVESTIGATIONSFBC, ESRBlood glucoseBUECalciumLFTsChest X-rayElectroencephalogram (EEG)CT scan (head) TREATMENT Treatment objectivesTo stop the seizureTo treat underlying causeTo prevent injuryNon-pharmacological treatmentMove sharp objects, fire etc. away from patient during seizuresEnsure clothing around the neck is looseEnsure the airway is clear, wipe or suction any secretions or vomitus from the mouth or nose.Do not force a spoon or tongue depressor into mouth!Remove false teeth if presentAfter convulsions cease, turn the patient into semi-prone position   by turning the patient on the side, with one leg bent and the other leg straightMonitor fits (fits chart)Pharmacological treatmentA.

Severe or 'complicated malaria' can arise from delay in diagnosis or inappropriate treatment of uncomplicated malaria. It mostly occurs in children under 5 years of age, pregnant women and non-immune individuals. The events causing most deaths in severe malaria are related to cerebral involvement (cerebral malaria), severe anaemia, hypoglycaemia, severe dehydration, renal failure and respiratory acidosis. The diagnosis of severe malaria is based on clinical features and confirmed with laboratory testing. Not all cases of severe malaria have high parasitaemia and initial blood film examination may be negative.Where the diagnosis is suspected, treatment must be started without delay while awaiting confirmation.SYMPTOMSPoor oral intake (e.g. breast milk in children)Repeated profuse vomitingDark or 'cola-coloured' urinePassing of very little urineDifficulty in breathingGeneralised weakness, inability to walk or sit without assistanceAltered consciousness (change of behaviour, confusion, delirium, coma)Repeated generalized convulsions SIGNSHyperpyrexia (axillary temperature > 38.5°C)Extreme pallor (severe anaemia; Hb < 5 g/dl)Marked jaundiceCirculatory collapse or shock (cold limbs, weak rapid pulse)Tachypnoea (Rapid breathing)Crepitations on chest examinationSweating (due to hypoglycaemia)Haemoglobinuria (dark or 'cola-coloured' urine)OliguriaSpontaneous unexplained  heavy  bleeding (disseminated intravascular coagulation)Altered consciousness (change of behaviour, confusion, delirium, coma) INVESTIGATIONSRapid diagnostic testBlood film for malaria parasites - thick and thin blood films (should be done where available)FBCSickling testRandom blood glucoseBUE and creatinineBlood grouping and cross-matchingLumbar puncture in the convulsing or comatose patient to exclude meningitis or encephalitis TREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo ensure rapid clearance of parasitaemiaTo provide urgent treatment for life threatening complications or conditions e.g. convulsions, hypoglycaemia, dehydration, renal impairmentTo provide appropriate supportive care Non-pharmacological treatmentPlace patients who are unconscious or having seizures in an appropriate position to prevent aspirationPharmacological treatmentEvidence Rating: [A]A.

     Note 18-10How to give Intramuscular Quinine Intramuscular Quinine in Young Children:Weigh the childPrepare a Quinine dilution of 50 mg/ml: Use a 10 ml sterile syringe and needle to drawup 5 mls of sterile water for injection or saline (notdextrose). Then into the same syringe draw up 300 mg (1ml) from an ampoule of Qui- nine. The syringe now contains 50 mg Quinine per ml.The dosage is 10 mg (0.2 ml) per kg or body weight every 8 hours. Calculate the volume to give based on body weight. (For examples of body weights and doses in children < 30 kg, sArtesunate, rectal, 10 mg/kg (preferred in children under 6 years;110).Administer by intramuscular injection to the thigh. If the diluted volume exceeds 3 ml, inject half the dose into each thigh.Intramuscular Quinine in Adults:Use a Quinine dilution of 100 mg/ml. To prepare this, draw 2 mls of Quinine 600 mg and add 4 mls of sterile water or saline (not dextrose)The dosage is 10 mg/kg body weight of Quinine given 8 hourly by deep IM injection, to a maximum dose of 600 mgSmall adults (weighing less than 60 kg) should be weighed to calculate the correct dose. Larger adults will simply receive the maximum dose (600 mg)If the required volume is more than 5 ml, divide it into two and inject at separate sites  Table 18-10: Dosing Regimen for Quinine IM Injection in young Children17.6-20.0 kg4.0 ml - half to each thigh20.1-22.5 kg4.5 ml - half to each thigh22.6-25.0 kg5.0 ml - half to each thigh25.1-27.5 kg5.5 ml - half to each thigh27.6-30.0 kg6.0 ml - half to each thighThe dosage for IM Quinine is 10 mg (0.2 ml) per kg of bodyweight every 8 hours.  
   
    
        
    
    

 Note 18-11Parenteral antimalarials and follow-on treatment.The current recommendation is to give parenteral antimalarials in the treatment of severe malaria for a minimum of 24 hours(irrespective of the patient's ability to tolerate oral medication) until the patient is able to tolerate oral medication as follow-on treatment.

SEVERE PRE-ECLAMPSIA AND IMMINENT ECLAMPSIA
This is an obstetric emergency and must be treated urgently. Treatment is the same as that of eclampsia (see below). These cases are best managed in hospital under the supervision of an obstetrician. While blood pressure reduction is essential, lowering the blood pressure below 140/90mmHg may cause foetal distress and should be avoided. BP monitoring must be carried out every 15-30 minutes until the BP is reduced and the patient is stable. There after monitoring can be done by 2-4 hourly. Daily weighing of the patient is essential.
SYMPTOMS

Frontal headaches
Vomiting
Visual disturbances such as double vision (diplopia), blurred vision, flashes of light
Epigastric pain
Decrease in urine production (oliguria)

SIGNS

Elevated blood pressure
Liver tenderness
Urine production of < 30 ml/hour or < 400 ml/24 hours
Increased tendon reflexes
Presence of ankle clonus (occasionally)

INVESTIGATIONS

FBC
Blood clotting profile (bedside clotting time, prothrombin time, INR, APTT)
Serum uric acid
BUE and Creatinine
Urinalysis and culture
Liver function tests
Random blood glucose
Daily assessment of urine proteins
Ultrasound scan for close foetal growth monitoring

TREATMENT
Treatment objectives

To reduce the blood pressure, but not lower than 140/90 mmHg
To prevent the mother from suffering from complications of the

hypertension such as a stroke

To prevent fits/eclampsia
To stabilise the patient and deliver her if eclampsia is imminent

Non-pharmacological treatment

Early delivery of mother if eclampsia is imminent
If the patient is not symptomatic and the pregnancy is less than 34 weeks allow pregnancy to continue if the foetal condition would allow
If the pregnancy is 34 weeks or more consider delivery after stabilisation

Pharmacological treatment
Evidence Rating: [C]
A. BP management in severe pre-eclampsia and imminent eclampsia

Hydralazine, IV, 5-10 mg slowly over 20-30 minutes

Or

Nifedipine, sublingual, 10 mg

Or

Labetalol, IV, 20 mg stat. over at least 1 minute. Repeat at 10-minute intervals if the BP remains > 160/110 mm Hg as follows: 40 mg; 80 mg; 80 mg boluses to a cumulative dose of 220 mg When the BP < 160/110 mmHg commence an infusion of 40 mg per hour.

Double the infusion rate at 30-minute intervals until satisfactory re- sponse or a dose of 160 mg per hour is attained.
Then

Nifedipine retard, oral, 20-40 mg daily

Or
Methyldopa, oral, 250-500 mg 8-12 hourly
A. Management or prevention of seizures in severe pre-eclampsia
and imminent eclampsia

Magnesium sulphate, IV, 20 ml of the 20% solution (4 g)

And

Magnesium sulphate, IM, 10 ml of the 50% solution, (5 g) into each buttock (total of 10 g)

REFERRAL CRITERIA
Refer all cases of severe pre-eclampsia and imminent eclampsia promptly to a hospital or obstetrician after initiation of treatment.
When the "obstetrician" considers that the foetus is immature, the patient should be transferred to a hospital capable of looking after the immature baby.





    
    
    

Neonates, pre-pubertal and pubertal children are also at risk of contracting STIs. The modes of transmission in these children are mostly through maternal infections, sexual abuse or exploitation and voluntary sexual activity in older children. The STls in this age group include neonatal conjunctivitis (ophthalmia neonatorum), and other STI-related syndromes similar to that in adults.Some of these STls (e.g., gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia), if acquired after the neonatal period, are indicative of sexual contact. For other STls, (e.g. HPV infections and vaginitis), the association with sexual contact is not clear.

The term newborn (neonate) refers to a baby in the first month of life. At birth all healthy newborns are active with a strong cry. Any baby born ill will show signs of poor activity or may be described as "being flat" or floppy in severe cases. The newborn with one or more abnormal vital signs is unwell.

This is an inherited disease characterized by the possession of two abnormal haemoglobins, at least one of which is haemoglobin S. There are various types, including HBSS, HBSC and HBS thalassaemia. The possession of one normal haemoglobin (haemoglobin A) together with one abnormal haemoglobin (e.g. AS or AC) constitute a haemoglobinopathy trait and not sickle cell disease.The use of the word (sickler) to describe patients with sickle cell disease must be avoided. Sickle cell disease patients may present either in the steady state, in crises or with complications. The crisis is commonly vaso-occlusive bone pain crisis. 0ther types of crises include acute chest syndrome, hyper-haemolytic crisis, aplastic crisis and sequestration crises. In vaso-occlusive crises there is occlusion of small vessels by sickled cells causing infarction and pain; in Acute Chest Syndrome (ACS), the patient presents with sudden onset of cough, difficulty in breathing and fever; in aplastic crises, infection with parvovirus causes sudden severe anaemia with a low reticulocyte count; in sequestration crises the spleen and liver enlarge rapidly due to trapping of red blood cells.Patients with sickle cell disease should be encouraged to have periodic check-ups at a sickle cell clinic.CAUSESInheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin genes from both parents, at least one of which is an S.Crises are typically precipitated by:cold weatherdehydrationinfectionphysical exertionmental stressSYMPTOMSJoint and bone pain, especially during cold wet seasonsEasy fatiguabilityPallorJaundiceDifficulty in breathing with or without chest painChronic leg ulcerAbdominal pain, especially in the splenic areaSpontaneous sustained erection without sexual arousal in male patients (See section on 'Priapism')SIGNSJaundicePallorHepatomegalySplenomegaly (may be absent in older patients)Old or recent scarification marks by traditional healers, particularly over the abdominal wall and jointsVenous ulcersBossingDactylitis (hand and foot syndrome)GnathopathyGrowth delay or tall, lanky stature ('marfanoid' habitus)INVESTIGATIONSFBCBlood film commentReticulocyte countSickling testHaemoglobin electrophoresisUrine examinationChest X-ray in case of ACSBlood and urine C/S when infection suspectedG6PD assay  TREATMENT Treatment objectivesTo prevent the development of sickle cell crisesTo relieve painTo identify and manage the precipitating cause of crisesTo maintain a good steady state haemoglobinTo prevent long term complications and organ damageTo manage sickle cell crises and complications once developedNon-pharmacological treatmentGood hydration at all times by drinking adequate water/fluidsAvoidance of common precipitating causes of crises such as malaria (bed nets etc.),dehydration, stress, excessive exercise, and exposure to extremes of weatherMaintenance of good nutritionClient educationParental/guardian educationGenetic counselling with voluntary family size restrictionGeneral public knowledgePharmacological TreatmentA.

SICKLE CELL DISEASE IN PREGNANCY
Pregnancy in the Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) patient is associated with poor obstetric outcomes for both the mother and her baby. Data from referral centres in Ghana show that sickle cell complications during pregnancy leads to high maternal and perinatal mortality. Common pregnancy complications of the mother with SCD include miscarriages, frequent vaso-occlusive crises, severe anaemia, recurrent urinary tract infections, acute chest syndrome, preterm labour and pulmonary embolism. In the foetus, complications include intrauterine growth restriction, prematurity and intrauterine foetal death. Care by a multidisciplinary team consisting of the Obstetricican, Physician specialist, Haematologist, Clinical Pharmacist, Anaesthetist, Nurse and Midwife ensures good health outcomes for these patients.

TREATMENT
Treatment objectives

To identify patients with condition early during pregnancy for closer monitoring
To correct anaemia
To prevent known crises triggers
To detect and manage promptly all associated complications and

crises

To deliver client safely as soon as baby is viable

Non-pharmacological treatment
Pre-pregnancy Care

Provide genetic counselling
Assist patient to plan pregnancy in a status of optimum health
Educate on potential risk and health problems of SCD in Pregnancy

Care during Pregnancy
At booking

Assess patient carefully for risk of frequent crises, and previous obstetric complications
Examine for nutritional status, anaemia,jaundice,and hepatosplenomegally
Perform ultrasound to date pregnancy and exclude foetal abnormality and growth retardation
Perform the above listed investigations to screen for and detect complications
Manage identified problems at booking (e.g. urinary tract infection, malaria etc.) appropriately and promptly

Follow up visits

If low risk, schedule follow up visits monthly until 2nd trimester, then 2 weekly until 28th week and thereafter weekly
If high-risk, schedule visits 2 weekly until third trimester, then weekly until term
At review visits, enquire about maternal well-being, symptoms of crises, infection and foetal Examine for pallor, jaundice, fever and proteinuria. Check for foetal growth and compare to gestational age

Labour and delivery

Stress and pain of labour and delivery can trigger crisis. Risks of crisis is increased if dehydration, fever, infection, hypothermia develop during Care during labour/delivery is targeted at preventing these triggers
All women with Sickle cell Disease must deliver in hospital, and the most experienced midwife and obstetrician should be involved in their care
In uncomplicated pregnancies, spontaneous vaginal delivery must be aimed at until 40 weeks (term). Induction must be undertaken only if the woman has not delivered after this
For the high risk women with recurrent complications deliver as soon as baby is viable
At admission in labour;
Labour should be monitored closely with partograph
Check for haemoglobin level
Group and cross-match a unit of blood on standby
Maintain good hydration with IV fluids
Provide adequate pain relief (See section on 'Analgesia in Labour')
Provide prophylactic antibiotics (See section on 'Antibiotic pro- phylaxis in labour and puerperium' below)
Vaginal delivery should be the aim unless there are obstetric reasons for cesarean section
Prolonged second stage labour should be avoided by offering assisted delivery (vacuum)
Active Management of Third Stage of Labour (AMTSL) is recommended to prevent PPH

Postpartum care

All Sickle Cell Disease patients must be hospitalized and monitored closely for at least 72 hours postpartum
Check for pallor, puerperal sepsis, acute chest syndrome, vaso- occlusive crises and urinary tract infection
Continue with prophylactic antibiotics for at least 72 hours postpartum
Counsel women and their support persons to avoid crises triggers such as stress, pain, lack of sleep, fatigue
Encourage early ambulation (especially after operative delivery)
Review client at 7 days postpartum and thereafter weekly until 6 weeks
Refer patient to physician for continuing care
Counsel on family planning and offer contraception

Baby

The baby should be screened for sickle cell disease
Closely monitor the babies with associated complications g. IUGR, prematurity etc.

Sickling crises in pregnancy

Admit all sickle cell patients with sickling and/or obstetric complications during pregnancy to a hospital
Avoid NSAIDs e.g. Diclofenac in the 3rd trimester
Opiods like pethidine and morphine for pain management should be used with care during labour due to respiration depression effects on baby (See section on Analgesia in Labour)
Identify and treat underlying triggers e.g UTI, malaria, dehydration etc. (See appropriate sections)
Blood transfusion is recommended if haemogloblin level is less than 7g/dl at 36 weeks and/or during crises (See section on 'Sickle Cell Disease')
If in vaso-oclusive crises maintain hydration with IV fluids (crystalloids) 2-4 litres in 24 hours, and provide analgesia (See section on 'Sickle Cell Disease')
Acute chest syndrome (ACS)- foetal monitoring is essential during this crisis (See section on 'Acute Chest Syndrome')

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic multisystem autoimmune inflammatory disease that has variable signs and follows a relapsing and remitting course. More than 90% of cases of SLE occur in women, commonly of childbearing age.This condition can lead to complications such as acute or chronic renal failure, seizures, psychosis, pleurisy, pleural effusion, pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension, pericarditis, myocarditis, leukopenia, lymphopaenia, thrombocytopenia and interstitial lung disease.Management of SLE often depends on the individual patient's disease severity and disease manifestations.CAUSESAutoimmuneGenetic and environmental factorsSYMPTOMSFatigueMalaiseFeverWeight lossRashHair lossMouth soresJoint painsSensitivity to sunlightSeizuresNauseaDyspepsiaAbdominal painSIGNSLymphadenopathyFeverMalar rashDiscoid rashFatigueArthralgiaArthroplastyMyalgiaArthritisPhotosensitivity rashAnaemiaINVESTIGATIONSFBC, ESRBUE and CreatinineUrinalysis with microscopyC - reactive proteinAntinuclear Antibodies (ANA)Anti-Double stranded DNA (dsDNA)Complement levelsLiver function testsSpot Urine protein/spot creatinine ratio0ther Autoantibody tests e.g. Extractable Nuclear Antigens(ENA)Hepatitis B and C screenHIV screenJoint radiographyChest radiographyEchocardiographyBrain MRI/MRA TREATMENT Treatment objectivesTo control symptomsTo adequately control underlying diseaseTo prevent and treat complicationsTo avoid possible long-term side effects of the drugsNon-pharmacological treatmentAvoidance of excessive sunlightRest as appropriateA low-fat diet with added fish oilAvoidance of estrogen-containing contraceptive pillsCounselling and Education NoteVaccinations: avoid 'live' vaccines in patients on greater than 10 mg prednisolone and/or immunosuppressive.

Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) result in several clinical syndromes caused by organisms that can be acquired and transmitted through sexual activity.They cause acute morbidity in adults and may result in long-term complications such as urethral stricture, infertility, ectopic pregnancy, anal fistula, cervical cancer, foetal wastage, prematurity, low birth weight, ophthalmia neonatorum and congenital syphilis. Their control is the cornerstone in improving reproductive health and reducing Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infections.Comprehensive management of STI is important and comprises prompt and effective case detection and treatment. However, owing to the lack of laboratory equipment and manpower in primary care facilities where most patients first present, an accurate diagnosis is often not possible. Also with most STIs, one cannot usually tell which organism is causing the infection from the history and physical examination alone. Multiple infections also occur, with each needing to be treated. Failure to treat one infection adequately may result in the development of serious complications.It is therefore more practical in managing STIs to base treatment on a 'syndromic diagnosis',which identifies all STIs that could cause a particular symptom or sign and provide treatment for each of them simultaneously. The common clinical syndromes associated with STIs include urethral discharge in males, persistent/recurrent urethral discharge, vaginal discharge, lower abdominal pain, genital ulcer, scrotal swellings, inguinal lymphadenopathy (buboes), ano-rectal syndromes (ano-rectal discharge, ulcers and vesicles), and genital warts. Scabies and pediculosis pubis may also be transmitted by sexual contact.In dealing with patients with STI, privacy and confidentiality, especially with the history taking and examination, are paramount.Education and counselling of STI patients and concurrent management of their partners provide additional opportunities to reduce the risk of STI in the community.(See section on 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases in Children' for STIs in children)

While a vaginal discharge is a notable clinical feature of an STI, not all forms of vaginal discharge are abnormal or indicative of an STI. A vaginal discharge may be associated with a physiological state such as menses or pregnancy, or with the presence or use of foreign substances and chemicals in the vagina.A careful risk assessment (See note below) of women with a  vaginal discharge may help identify STIs and non-STIs and selection of appropriate treatment regimens based on the most likely aetiology of the vaginal discharge. 0ther considerations for selecting treatment include pregnancy status and patient discomfort.CAUSES • Neisseria gonorrhoea • Chlamydia trachomatis • Trichomonas vaginalis (green or yellow, smelly, bubbly or frothy discharge associated with itching) • Herpes simplex virus (following first episode of infection)SYMPTOMS • Vaginal discharge- change in colour, odour, consistency or amount • Vulval swelling • Pain on urination • Lower abdominal or back painSIGNS • Vaginal discharge • Vulval swelling • Vulval erythema • Lower abdominal tenderness • Cervical excitation tenderness • Cervical mucopus or erosions (on speculum examination)INVESTIGATIONS • High vaginal swab for microscopy, culture and sensitivity (if available)TREATMENTTreatment objectives • To identify and treat non-STI vaginitis (especially candidiasis, which is frequently diagnosed in women being evaluated for STIs) • To assess STI risk and treat STI-related infections appropriately • To prevent complications and sequelae • To treat both partners simultaneously as much as possibleNon-pharmacological treatment • None for STI-related dischargePharmacological TreatmentEvidence Rating: [C]A.

Strabismus is misalignment usually of one eye preventing simultaneous viewing of an object by both eyes. 0nset in children under 7 years interferes with the development of the visual system of the deviating eye in the brain leading to amblyopia. Acute onset at an older age causes double vision. Diplopia does not occur in children because of the ability to suppress the second image or development of amblyopia. Amblyopia does not occur if the deviation alternated from one eye to the other. The more frequent types are horizontal misalignment. Esotropia is convergent deviation and exotropia is divergent deviation.CAUSESCongenital misalignmentAcquired deviationParalysis of the cranial nerve VI, III or IVFibrosis in an extraocular muscleMyasthenia gravisIntraocular lesion e.g. retinoblastoma and macular scarSYMPTOMSMisalignment of the eyeImpaired judgement of depth or distanceDiplopia or double visionSIGNSDeviation of the corneal light reflex in one eye from a central positionMovement of the deviating eye to take up fixation when the fixing eye is coveredNormal extraocular eye movement (in non-paralytic strabismus)Limitation of eye movement (in paralytic or restrictive strabismus)Hypermetropia on refraction in childrenRetinal lesion e.g. retinoblastomaINVESTIGATIONSCycloplegic refraction in childrenOther specific tests for suspected causes e.g. myasthenia gravis or retinoblastomaTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo identify and correct any significant refractive errorTo treat any amblyopiaTo relieve any diplopiaTo correct the misalignmentTo treat any underlying conditionNon-pharmacological treatmentSpectacle correction of any refractive errorTreatment of amblyopia in the deviating eye by patching the non- deviating eyeUse of prisms to correct small deviationsPatching of the deviating eye to relieve diplopia in older patientsPharmacological treatmentNilREFERRAL CRITERIAAll patients diagnosed with strabismus must be referred to the eye specialist for further management.





    
    
    

Stridor is an emergency condition. It has a characteristic noise in the inspiratory phase of breathing. This occurs when there is an obstruction of the upper airway from the nasopharnyx down to the trachea and main bronchi. The obstruction is usually in the subglottic area.It is commonly a viral illness, and may be preceded usually by the common cold. Measles may also be complicated by Laryngotracheobronchitis (LTB). Two important causes of stridor in children are viral croup (LTB) and acute epiglottitis.In the management of stridor, steroids are most useful when given within 6 hours of onset of symptoms. Cough syrups containing opiates and atropine are contraindicated.STRIDOR IN CHILDRENCAUSESViral (laryngotracheobronchitis)Bacterial infectionAcute epiglottitisInflammatory obstructionInhalation of hot fumes e.g. in fire outbreaksAngioneurotic oedemaRetropharyngeal abscessInhalation of a foreign bodyCongenital malformation of the larynx e.g. laryngomalaciaSYMPTOMSLow grade feverHoarse voiceBarking coughBreathing difficultyRestlessnessSIGNLow grade feverRestless apprehensive child when obstruction is severeHoarse voiceBarking coughLaboured breathing e.g. suprasternal, supraclavicular, substernal and intercostals retractionsTachypnoeaCyanosis in severe obstructionReddened throatINVESTIGATIONSSputum cultureLateral soft tissue X-ray of neckChest X-ray TREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo avoid aggravation of the obstruction with thick or crusted secretionsTo ensure early and timely relief of obstructionNon-pharmacological treatmentEnsuring good hydration including liberal oral fluidsEnsure maximum rest for the childEstablish the airway by intubation or tracheostomy in severe obstructionPharmacological treatmentA.

A stroke can be defined as a sudden global or focal neurological deficit resulting from spontaneous haemorrhage or infarction of the central nervous system, with objective evidence of an infarction or haemorrhage, irrespective of the duration of clinical symptoms. A CT or MRI scan is required to make the diagnosis and exclude other intracranial lesions that could present similarly.A Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA), on the other hand, is a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia. There is no objective evidence of acute infarction in the affected region of brain or retina.In adults, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, atrial fibrillation and smoking, increase the risk for strokes. In children sickle cell disease and cyanotic heart disease are important risk factors for strokes.Patients should ideally have multidisciplinary care.CAUSES • Cerebral infarction:Thrombosis of a cerebral vesselEmbolism from a distant site (e.g. atrial fibrillation) • Intracerebral haemorrhage • Subarachnoid haemorrhageSYMPTOMS • Weakness of one side of the body including the face • Inability to rise up from a sitting or lying position • Sudden fall/collapse • Loss of speech • Loss of vision • Severe headache and/or neck pain (subarachnoid haemorrhage) • Unconsciousness in some patients • SeizuresSIGNS • Paralysis of a limb • Facial paralysis (lower half) • Initial flaccidity of limbs, but later spasticity and exaggerated reflexes • Hemianopia (loss of one-half of visual field) • Hemi-anaesthesia (loss of sensation of one-half of body) • Extensor plantar response • Dysarthria/dysphasia (alteration of speech) • Neck stiffness (in subarachnoid haemorrhage)INVESTIGATIONS • FBC, ESR • Blood glucose • Serum lipid profile • Blood urea, electrolytes and creatinine • Uric acid • ECG • CT scan/MRI of the head • Chest X-ray TREATMENT Treatment objectives • To limit the area of brain damage • To protect patients from the dangers of unconsciousness and immobility • To prevent aspiration • To treat the underlying cause if possible • To identify and manage modifiable risk factors (hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes mellitus etc.) • To institute measures to improve functional recovery • To support and rehabilitate patients who survive with residual disability • To minimise adverse effects of drug therapyNon-pharmacological treatmentAdmit and monitor patient's vital signs and neurological signs frequently (4 hourly)Establish adequate airway in unconscious patientsSwallowing test in an upright position (use 10-15ml of water)Insert nasogastric tube as early as possible for feeding and medications in unconscious patients or those with swallowing difficulties to prevent aspirationNurse in the lateral position with suctioning where necessaryElevate head of bed to 30 degrees to reduce intracranial pressurePrevent pressure sores by regular turning (every 2 hours) in bedMaintain adequate hydrationKeep patient clean and dry by frequent use of bedpan/urine pot, diapers, condom catheter as required.

A seriously ill child is one whose vitals are compromised. A structured approach in determining the cause and subsequent successful management of the child is necessary. Rapid assessment and urgent intervention are the major requirements in the approach.Triaging soon after their arrival in hospital for emergency signs like severe respiratory distress or coma and priority signs like high temperature, restlessness or severe pain is important.Presentations of serious illness may be classified under the following problem areas; airway/breathing, cardiac, shock and neurological disability.The structured approach includes:Primary assessmentResuscitationSecondary assessmentEmergency treatmentDefinitive careAIRWAY/BREATHING PROBLEMSCAUSESSevere PneumoniaBronchiolitisUpper airway obstruction or stridorOthersSIGNS AND SYMPTOMSDepends on conditionAPPROACHPrimary assessmentCan child speak?

Indicates airway patencyAdequacy of breathing assessed by recession, respiratory rate, grunting, inspiratory or expiratory noises, flaring of the alae nasiEffectiveness of breathing is assessed by breath sounds, chest expansion and abdominal excursionFinal effects of inadequate respiration are determined from the heart rate, skin colour and mental statusPulse oximetry desirable. A saturation of less than 90% while  breathing air or less than 95% while breathing oxygen is very lowHigh flow oxygen should be given to all children with respiratory difficulty or hypoxia. In a child with inadequate ventilation, bag valve mask oxygenation or intubation may be requiredINVESTIGATIONSChest X-rayArterial blood gasPeak flow (if asthma a possibility)MANAGEMENTIf a chin lift or jaw thrust can secure airway then do so, otherwise consider intubationRESPIRATORY; if bubbly noises heard, airway full of secretions, suction requiredHarsh stridor with barking cough and severe respiratory distress, more likely to be upper airway obstruction, nebulise with adrenaline (5ml of 1:1000 in oxygen)If symptoms had a sudden onset and there is history of inhalation, consider laryngeal foreign body. Call an ENT surgeon immediatelyChildren with a history of asthma and respiratory distress require nebulized salbutamol 2.5 mg or 5 mg if 7 years plus and oxygenCIRCULATION/CARDIOVASCULARWhen normal capillary refill time is more than 2 seconds, then there is no problem with cardiac output. Cardiac arrest predominantly occurs secondary to hypoxia or hypovolaemia. Primary myocardial disease is rare.CAUSESHeart failureArrhythmias (heart rhythm abnormalities)APPROACHPrimary assessment, with regard to circulation;Heart ratePulse volumeCapillary refillBlood pressureLook for tachycardia, bradycardia, abnormal pulse volume, hypotension or hypertension, hepatomegaly, murmurs and peripheral oedemaCheck the effects of circulatory inadequacy on other organs by:checking the respiratory rate skin appearance and temperature mental status and urinary outputINVESTIGATIONSUrea electrolytesChest X-rayECGFull blood countBlood cultureMANAGEMENTAddress airways and breathing before commencing external cardiac massageIf cardiac output is not responding to CPR, reconsider the adequacy of airway and breathing supportSHOCK (INADEQUATE CIRCULATION)CAUSESSevere gastroenteritisDiarrhoeaCardiac diseaseMANAGEMENTResuscitation - every child in shock should have oxygen at a high flow rate. Venous or intraosseous access should be obtained and an infusion of normal saline at 20 ml/kg givenIn drowsiness with sighing respirations check blood sugar and acid base balance. Treat diabetic ketoacidosis with IV normal saline and insulin In an unconscious child with pinpoint pupils consider opiatepoisoning. Try naloxone.Gastrointestinal: Usually presents with shock from fluid loss. Symptoms include vomiting, abdominal pain or bloody stools; signs may include abdominal tenderness or a mass.

Abuse of substances such as marijuana, benzodiazepines, heroine, cocaine etc. is prevalent in many communities around the country. Typically, individuals with such disorders request help only after they are forced to do so by family members. They may also begin to have withdrawal symptoms when on admission for serious physical illness. This is because they have no access to the substance being abused. This may complicate treatment of the primary disease for which they were admitted.CAUSESSocial factorsPeer pressure (e.g. family members, friends)Lack of coping skills (e.g. with life's difficulties, aids to coping in times of trouble)AddictionTolerance (increased requirement of substance to maintain the same feeling)Withdrawal effects (unpleasant effects lead to a return to drug use)SYMPTOMSCannabis withdrawalInsomniaShakinessIrritabilityRestlessnessAnxietyAngerOnset: Within 24 hours of drug useDuration: 1-2 weeksBenzodiazepine withdrawalAnxietyHeadacheInsomniaMuscle aching and twitchingPerceptual changesFeelings of unrealityDepersonalizationSeizuresOnset: 1-10 days (depending on half-life of drug)Duration: 3-6 weeks (may be longer)Opioid withdrawalAnxietyCravingMuscle tensionMuscle and bone acheMuscle cramps and sustained contractionsSleep disturbanceSweatingHot and cold flushesPiloerectionYawningLacrimation and rhinorrhoeaAbdominal crampsNausea, vomiting and diarrhoeaPalpitationsElevated pulse and blood pressureDilated pupilsOnset: 6-24 hours (may be later with longer-acting opioids)Duration: peaks 2-4 days, ceases 5-10 days (more prolonged for longer-acting opioids)Psychostimulant withdrawalCrash (fatigue, flat affect, increased sleep, reduced cravings)Withdrawal (fluctuating mood and energy levels, cravings, disturbed sleep, poor concentration)Extinction (persistence of withdrawal features, gradually subsiding)Onset: 6-12 hours (cocaine); 12-24 hours (amphetamines)Duration: Several weeks for withdrawal phase, then months for extinctionSIGNSCannabis withdrawalSame as symptomsBenzodiazepine withdrawalSame as symptomsOpioid withdrawalSame as symptomsPsychostimulant withdrawalSame as symptomsINVESTIGATIONSToxicology screen for suspected substancesBox 10-2: Screening of patients suspected of substance abusePhysical appearanceSweating, tremor, agitation, problem with coordination, gait.

TESTICULAR TORSION (TORSION OF SPERMATIC CORD)This is cessation of blood supply to the testis due to twisting of the spermatic cord. This is a medical emergency that needs to be recognized before the cardinal signs and symptoms are fully manifest as prompt surgery saves the testes. Delay in treatment could result in testicular atrophy, abnormal sperm count leading to infertility/sterility. It can be classified into intravaginal torsion, which constitute more than 95% and extra-vaginal torsion, which is usually found in infants. About 50% of torsion occurs during sleep and early in the morning. It is rare in older children and adults but common in children under 15 years.CAUSESUndescended testisBell-clapper malformationHorizontal lie of testis/inversion of testisLong mesorchiumTraumaSpasm of cremaster musclesSYMPTOMSSudden onset of acute severe pain in one testicle or recurrent pain which resolves spontaneously (recurrent torsion and detorsion)Pain may occur typically early in the morningLower abdominal pain on affected sideNausea and vomitingNo urinary symptomsNo feverSIGNSSwollen, tender and abnormal position of testis and epididymis.Shortened & twisted cord.Oedema/reddening of scrotal wallRight testis - twisted clockwiseLeft testis - twisted anticlockwisePrehn's sign is absent(elevation of scrotum in the palm towards the Pubic symphysis does not relieve pain)

TetanusTetanus is a disease caused by a bacterium, which produces a neurotoxin responsible for the clinical features. These bacteria live predominantly in the soil, so it is easy to get this infection whenever a break in the skin is not cleaned properly. Tetanus-prone wounds include burns, puncture injuries, or those contaminated by soil/manure, septic wounds, and those with much devitalised tissue and compound fractures. The use of non-sterilised instruments or dressings on the umbilical cord predisposes to neonatal tetanus. The incubation period is 3-21 days.Tetanus should be treated as a medical emergency. Tetanus immunisation is the key for prevention (See section on 'Immunisation').CAUSE • Clostridium tetaniSYMPTOMS • Difficulty or inability to open mouth • Constipation • Stiff body • Spasms- these are painful and are triggered by noise, bright light or touch; spontaneous in severe cases.SIGNS • Umbilicus may be infected • Presence of wound (but may have healed) • Irritability • Cyanosis during spasms • Sardonic (mocking) smile • Lock jaw (cannot open the mouth) • 0pisthotonus (stiff arched back) • Rigid abdomen and stiff neck and limbsINVESTIGATIONS • No confirmatory test (diagnosis is clinical) TREATMENTTreatment objectives • To prevent further spasms • To eliminate Clostridium tetani to stop further toxin production • To neutralise circulating toxin • To provide adequate hydration and nutrition • To provide supportive care till spasms cease completelyNon-pharmacological treatment • Always admit a suspected case of tetanus • Maintain a clear airway • Avoid noise, bright light and unnecessary physical examination of the patient • Clean the infected umbilicus or wound with soap and water or antiseptic solution (See section on 'Wound management') • Surgical debridement of the wound when necessaryPharmacological treatmentA.

THE EMPTY SCROTUMThis refers to the absence of testis(es) in the scrotum/hemiscrotum. Ten percent of cases are bilateral. Seventy-five percent of full term infants with undescended testes and 90% of premature infants would have spontaneous descent of testes from the intra-abdominal site by the age of on year. Persistent undescent of the testis is associated with an increased risk of malignancy, subfertility, atrophy of the testis and torsion. All health workers who see neonates and children should do routine examination of the scrotum and testis to prevent late presentations and complications.CAUSESUndescended testesUnknown/idiopathic; most cases are congenitalPremature birthGenetically inherited diseasesAssociated with anomalies like Prune Belly syndrome and hypospadiasEctopic testisRetractile testisSevere atrophyOrchidectomyAgenesis of the testes (rarely)SYMPTOMSAbsence of one or both testesIn children, parents or the health worker may notice this at birthSIGNSAbsent testis in both supine and upright positionsINVESTIGATIONSUltrasound scan of abdomen, pelvis and inguinal canalTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo decrease potential for cancerTo improve fertilityTo repair herniaTo decrease risk of torsionTo avoid social and psychological complicationsNon-pharmacological treatmentSurgical intervention before two years of age.

Hypoglycaemia refers  to a blood glucose level below 3.6 mmol/L.   It is more common in elderly diabetics and those with kidney function impairment as well as those on long-acting oral anti-hyperglycaemic medications or insulin. Severe hypoglycaemia (blood glucose < 2.2 mmol/L) may result in alteration of consciousness, fits, self-injury and various degrees of irreversible brain damage.Following successful treatment of hypoglycaemia, its cause must be determined and measures, including patient education and revision of anti-hyperglycaemic drug doses, should be taken to prevent its recurrence.CAUSESOverdose of any anti-hyperglycaemic medication i.e. insulin or oral agentAntihyperglycaemic medication use in renal impairment and the elderlyOmitted or inadequate amount of foodUnaccustomed physical over-activityExcessive alcohol intakeSYMPTOMSDizzinessBlurred visionHeadachesPalpitationSweatingShaking of the hands and bodyUnconsciousnessConvulsionsIrritability and abnormal behaviour especially in childrenSIGNSSweatingTremorsTachycardia and bounding pulseConfusionUnconsciousnessConvulsionsINVESTIGATIONSRandom blood glucose (urgently done using a glucose meter)Blood urea and electrolytesLiver function testsTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo rapidly restore blood glucose levels to normalTo maintain the level of blood glucose within the normal range until the patient can begin eating normallyTo identify and address the causeNon-pharmacological treatmentMild hypoglycaemia2-3 teaspoons of granulated sugar or 3 cubes of sugar or ½ a bottle of soft drink (sugar-containing, not 'diet' drinks) to indi- viduals who are conscious.A glass of milk or fruit drink and a tablespoonful of honey are useful alternativesThe above measures should be followed immediately by a meal or snackModerate hypoglycaemiaSame as for mild hypoglycaemia, but repeat after 10 minutes.

Tuberculosis (TB) may affect any part of the body, but the commonest site is the lung (Pulmonary TB). 0ther sites affected include the spine, bone and joints, brain, urinary tract, abdomen and lymph nodes etc. Pulmonary TB patients who have acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in their sputum (bacteriologically positive TB) are most infectious and spread the disease through airborne droplets when they cough, spit or sneeze. Drinking unpasteurized milk may cause bovine TB, which manifests as abdominal TB. Persons with lowered resistance to infection, such as HIV/AIDS and diabetes, are especially at risk of developing TB. Such individuals tend not to have the typical symptoms and signs of TB. They may have features such as fever, weight loss and diarrhoea, which could also be attributed to the condition.In children with severe malnutrition who show poor response to dietary treatment, TB must be considered and excluded.

TYPHOID FEVERTyphoid fever (enteric fever) is a severe bacterial illness, which occurs where sanitary conditions are poor permitting contamination of food or water with faeces. The bacteria which are spread by the faeco-oral route invade the intestinal wall and spread through the bloodstream to all organs. They are passed into the stool and urine of infected patients. 0rganisms may continue to be present in the stool of healthy carriers, i.e. patients with positive stool cultures, 12 months after treatment or those with long-term subclinical disease.If improperly treated typhoid fever may result in complications such as intestinal perforation with peritonitis, bloody stools, acute psychosis and severe intravascular haemolysis leading to acute kidney injury (especially in G6PD deficiency).Public education on good personal hygiene, hand washing and appropriate disposal of solid waste would often prevent the disease. Screening of food handlers by carrying out stool cultures to exclude carrier status and safe handling of food, fruits and vegetables are also helpful preventive measures.CAUSESSalmonella typhi and paratyphiSYMPTOMSFever which increases gradually to a high fever and persists for weeks (fever does not respond to antimalarials)Constipation in the early stagesAbdominal pain and diarrhoea in the second week of illnessSevere headacheDry coughPsychosis and confusion may occurSIGNSHigh fever with a relatively slow pulse rate (occasionally pulse is fast especially with myocarditis or intestinal perforation)Abdominal tendernessHepato-splenomegaly (tender)ConfusionSigns of chest infection (pneumonitis)INVESTIGATIONSFBC, differential,RDT / blood film for malaria parasite (to exclude malaria)Blood cultureStool cultureUrine cultureNote 18-8Notes on DiagnosisDiagnosis of typhoid fever is based on a strong clinical suspicion backed byBlood cultures, positive during first 10 days of feverStool cultures, positive after 10th day up to 4th or 5th weekUrine cultures, positive during 2nd and 3rd weekThe above tests are superior to the Widal test, which is unreliable and rarely useful in confirming a diagnosis of typhoid fever.

URETHRAL STRICTUREThis refers to a narrowing or complete obstruction of the urethral lumen due to fibrosis (scarring). It is the second commonest cause of retention of urine in Ghana and the most common in young males usually resulting from previous inadequately treated STI. The commonest site is the anterior urethra i.e. bulbar and penile urethra in males. It may be complicated by periurethral abscess, superficial extravasation of urine and urethrocutaneous fistulae, retention of urine and post-renal renal failure.CAUSESGonococcal or non-gonococcal urethritisExternal trauma e.g. road traffic injuries, falls, straddle or astride injury and pelvic fracturesIatrogenic: Urethral instrumentation e.g. catheterisation, endoscopyPostoperative e.g. prostatectomyCongenital strictures (rare)SYMPTOMSLower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) e.g. poor urinary stream, split  or splayed stream, reduced caliber of stream improved by straining, frequency and dysuria, post-void dribbling, incomplete emptying of bladderUrinary (overflow) incontinenceUrinary retention (acute or chronic)SIGNSThere may be none in uncomplicated casesPalpable induration of urethraPeriurethral abscessesExtravasation of urine into scrotum and superficial tissueUrethrocutaneous fistulas/watering-can scrotumBladder may be palpable if there is retentionKidney may be palpable in hydronephrosisLocalized induration may be felt along the urethraFailure of catheterisation - this heightens the suspicion of a strictureINVESTIGATIONSUrinalysisUrine culture and sensitivityBlood urea, electrolytes and creatinineUltrasound Scan of kidneys, bladder, postvoid residual urine and spongiofibrosisRetrograde urethrogramAntegrade urethrogram/Micturating Cysto-uretrogram (MCUG) provided a suprapubic catheter is in placeUroflowmetryUrethrocystoscopyTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo relieve symptoms and prevent complicationTo treat underlying causeNon-pharmacological treatmentTry catheterisation - a gentle attempt is made to pass a urethral catheter, which will be held up, at the site of stricture in patients who present with retention of urine.

URINARY SCHISTOSOMIASISThis is a water-borne disease caused by penetration of the skin      or mucous membranes by the early stages of the causative organism (Schistosoma haematobium), which in the adult form settles in the blood vessels of the urinary bladder resulting in the common presentation of haematuria.This disease is common in Ghana with several endemic areas along the lakes, slow-flowing rivers and irrigation systems. The commonest body sites affected are the bladder, ureter sand pelvic organs. Prevention entails avoiding contact with infested water. Chronic infestation may lead to severe anaemia, ureteric stricture and hydronephrosis as well as carcinoma of the bladder.CAUSESchistosoma haematobiumSYMPTOMSInitialItching and redness of skin at site of penetration of parasiteFatigue, low grade fever, malaise, lassitude, excessive sweating,headache and backacheLaterTerminal haematuriaPainful urination (dysuria)Lower abdominal pain (bladder pain)SIGNSPallorPalpable kidney from hydronephrosis due to ureteric stricturePalpable bladder from bladder cancer or retention of urine due to clots or bladder neck stenosisDRE may reveal a fibrosed prostate, enlarged seminal vesicle or thickened bladder baseINVESTIGATIONSFBCUrine for red blood cells, pus cells, and schistosoma ova (mid-day urine specimen preferably taken after physical exercise is ideal)Midstream urine for culture in associated urinary tract infectionsImaging: Ultrasound scan; Intravenous Urogram(IVU) may show calcification of bladder, ureters, hydronephrosis and hydrouretersTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo eliminate the causative organismTo manage the complicationsNon-pharmacological treatmentAvoid repeated exposure to infested water bodies if possiblePharmacological treatmentEvidence Rating: [A]Praziquantel, oral,Adults and Children40 mg/kg as a single doseTreat anaemia if present (See section on 'Anaemia')REFERRAL CRITERIARefer patient  after adequate  treatment   if:  haematuria  and/ or symptoms of urinary infection persist or if complications like hydronephrosis, bladder mass, retention of urine, severe wasting and severe anaemia are present. 





    
    
    

URINARY TRACT CALCULIThese are crystal-like objects, which form in various parts of the urinary tract. They consist mainly of mineral salts i.e. crystal-forming ions. Some of the common stone-types include calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, magnesium ammonium phosphate and uric  acid.  Some risk factors in developing stones include crystalluria, affluence, diet, occupation, climate (dehydration), family history and medications.

RETENTION OF URINERetention of urine is inability to empty a full bladder. It is the commonest urological emergency in Ghana and worldwide. Adult males are more commonly affected. It is rare in children and in females. The causes differ in different age groups as well as in males and females. A family history of retention of urine in Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH), prostate cancer, breast cancer and ovarian cancer are risk factors.Retention of urine can be classified into three:Acute retention of Urine is of sudden onset with a palpable tender bladder.Chronic Retention of Urine is of insidious onset and presents with a palpable non-tender bladder and overflow incontinence resulting in more damage to the bladder, ureters and kidneys. Post-renal renal failure may complicate this type of retention with hydronephroses and hydroureters.Acute-on-chronic retention of urine is when a chronic retention of urine is suddenly complicated by acute retention of urine.CAUSESAdult males - (above50 years): BPH, urethral strictures, bladder neck  stenosisAdult males - (below 50 years/young males): urethral strictures, urethral injuries, bladder neck stenosis, neurogenic bladder/spinal injury, paraphimosis, urethral caculi, acute prostatitisMale children - posterior urethral valves, meatal stenosis, phimosis, urethral calculi, congenital stricturesAdult females - retroverted gravid uterus, uterine fibroids/myomas, impacted ovarian cysts, neurogenic (postoperative and pelvic inflammatory disease), carcinoma of cervix with infiltration into the urethraSYMPTOMSRetention of urine in BPH precipitated by postponement of micturition, alcohol abuse and infectionSudden inability to pass urine with painful bulge in lower abdomen for acute retention of urineGradual onset of inability to pass urine with painless bulge in lower abdomen for chronic retention of urineHistory of urethritis, urethral instrumentation (e.g. catheterisation) or perineal injury, pelvic fracture or surgery in urethral stricturesInternational Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)SIGNSPalpable tender bladder in acute retention of urinePalpable non-tender bladder for chronic retention of urineUraemia/Azotaemia in renal failureFever in infections: UTI and prostatitisPalpable kidneys in hydronephrosisHaematuria in BPH, prostate cancer and urethral stricturesREFERRAL CRITERIAPatients with hydronephroses on ultrasound scan and renal failure should be referred to specialist. 





    
    
    

URTICARIAUrticaria or wheal is a transient, itchy swelling of the skin secondary to the release of histamine. Each episode of wheal may last a few minutes or several hours and may change shape. Wheals may be round, or formrings, a map-like pattern or giant patches. The surface wheals may be accompanied by deeper swelling of mucous membrane such as the eyelids, lips, hands and other parts of the body. The deeper swelling is called angioedema.Urticaria is classified as acute urticaria if the condition lasts less than six (6) weeks and chronic urticaria if it lasts more than six (6) weeks. Causes of acute urticarias can easily be identified as against those for chronic urticaria. CAUSESMedicines e.g. penicillins, cephalosporins, aspirin, NSAIDS, toxoids, animal sera, morphine, radiocontrast media, ACE inhibitorsFoods e.g. fish, nuts, eggs, chocolate, shellfish, pork, spices, milk, cheese, food dyes, additivesInfections e.g. sepsis, hepatitis (viral)Latex e.g. gloves, medical equipmentMedical conditions e.g. lupus erythematosus, lymphoma, polycythaemiaPlantsIdiopathicEnvironmental and physical factorsPressure urticaria: wheals appear on the area of skin experiencing any form of pressure e.g. soles of feet after prolong standingSolar, cold and heat urticaria: wheals appear when exposed to these environmentsAquagenic urticaria: exposure to water leads to itchy whealsCholinergic urticaria: intense pruritic wheals are seen in response to sweating, exercise, emotions, and hot foodsDermographism: linear wheals noticed as a result of scratching or pressure SYMPTOMSItchingWheals SIGNSWhealsDemographismAngioedemaINVESTIGATIONSUsually noneFull blood count (may show eosinophilia related to allergy or parasitic infestation or low white blood count from systemic lupus erythematosus)Stool REThyroid antibodies and function (in chronic urticaria if autoimmune origin is considered likely)Skin biopsy (if wheals are prolonged, to identify vasculitis) TREATMENTTreatment ObjectivesTo provide immediate reliefTo prevent complications such as anaphylaxis, shock or asphyxiationTo identify possible underlying cause and address it.

URINARY TRACT INFECTIONUrinary tract infection (UTI) is the presence of micro-organisms in the urine or tissues of the normally sterile genitourinary tract. Infection may be localized to the bladder alone or the kidneys or, in men the prostate.Acute uncomplicated UTI occurs in women with a normal genitourinary tract and usually manifests as acute cystitis (bladder infection or lower tract infection). Complicated UTI occurs in individuals with structural or functional abnormalities of the genitourinary tract, including those with indwelling devices such as urethral catheters. Congenital abnormalities of the genito-urinary tract predispose children to UTI. Proven UTI in a child or recurrent UTI requires further urogenital evaluation. Definitive treatment of UTI depends on culture and sensitivity reports. However, empirical treatment may be initiated while awaiting the report.CAUSESBacteraemia or septicaemiaUrinary tract obstruction e.g. enlarged prostate in adult males, posterior urethral valves in infants/childrenSYMPTOMSFrequent painful urinationHaematuriaCloudy/foul smelling urineVomitingSuprapubic painFever - may be persistent and unexplained (in children)There may be feeding problems, diarrhoea, and failure to thrive as well (in children)SIGNSFeverLoin tendernessSuprapubic tendernessFoul smelling urineINVESTIGATIONSFBCMid-stream specimen of urine for microscopy, culture and sensitivity (re-culture urine aftertreatment)Abdominal ultrasound scan in children if indicatedTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo relieve symptoms such as fever and pain (See section on 'Fever' and 'Pain Management')To eradicate causative agentTo prevent complicationsTo identify patients with abnormalities of the genito-urinary tractNon-pharmacological treatmentLiberal oral fluids to encourage good urinary outputPersonal hygiene and proper cleaning after defaecationPharmacological treatmentTreatment of Uncomplicated UTI1st Line Treatment Evidence Rating: [C]Ciprofloxacin, oral,Adults500 mg 12 hourly for 7 days (female); 10-14 days (male)Children15-20 mg/kg 12 hourly; (max. of 750 mg daily in two divided doses)OrCefuroxime, oral,Adults250-500 mg 12 hourly for 5-7 days (female); 10-14 days (male)Children12-18 years; 250 mg 12 hourly for 5-7 days2-12 years; 15 mg/ kg 12 hourly (max. 250 mg) for 5-7 days3 months-2 years; 10 mg/kg 12 hourly (max. 125 mg) for 5-7 daysTreatment of Complicated UTI (including catheter-related, stones, prostate enlargement, urologic abnormalities and pregnancy)1st Line Treatment Evidence Rating: [C]Ciprofloxacin, IV,Adults400 mg 8-12 hourly for 7 days (to be administered over 60 minutes)OrGentamicin, IV, (if kidney function is normal)Adults40-80 mg 8 hourly for 7 daysChildren12-18 years; 2 mg/kg 8 hourly for 7 days1 month-12 years; 2.5 mg/kg 8 hourly for 7 daysOrCeftriaxone, IV,Adults1-2 g daily for 7 daysChildrenAll ages 25 mg/kg 12 hourly (max. 75 mg/kg daily)OrAmoxicillin + Clavulanic Acid, IV,Children1 month-18 years; 20-30 mg/kg 8 hourly (max. 500 mg) for 5-7 daysNeonates (dose doubled in severe infection)7-28 days; 30 mg/kg 8 hourly for 5-7days< 7 days; 30 mg/kg 12 hourly for 5-7daysAndGentamicin, IV, (slow intravenous injection over at least3 minutes)Children12-18 years; 2 mg/kg 8 hourly1 month-12 years; 2.5 mg/kg 8 hourlyOrCefuroxime, IV,Children1 month-18 years; 20 mg/kg 8 hourly max. 750 mg, (increase to 40-50 mg/kg max. 1.5g 6-8 hourly in severe infections)Neonates (double the dose in severe infections, IV route only) 21-28 days; 25 mg/kg 6 hourly7-12 days; 25 mg/kg 8 hourly< 7 days; 25 mg/kg 12 hourlyREFERRAL CRITERIARefer patients who are very ill, with recurrent UTI, persistent haematuria and congenital abnormalities to the appropriate specialist.





    
    
    

VASECTOMY (MALE STERILISATION)Vasectomy is a permanent male contraceptive method, which is a simple, short and safe surgical procedure. It is carried out by trained surgeons usually under local anaesthesia after careful counselling and informed consent. Vasectomy is the most effective male family planning method. Involving males in issues of reproductive health and family planning has several benefits with a positive impact on society.Vasectomy should be encouraged for appropriate clients. It is less invasive and simpler than female sterilisation. Reversal of vasectomy is a difficult surgery using loupes/microscope with success rate of 60-80% if done in less than 3 years after vasectomy. REFERRAL CRITERIAClients should be referred to a Family Planning Unit or Urologist for the procedure.





    
    
    

14. VomitingVomiting can be induced by a variety of disease processes including gastrointestinal, neurologic, renal, psychiatric, cardiovascular, endocrine, pain and the effects of drugs. The best course of action in identifying the underlying cause is to carry out a detailed clinical evaluation and management plan, looking out for the aetiology, consequences and potential complications of vomiting.Severe uncontrolled vomiting can result in significant dehydration and electrolyte imbalance accompanied by renal complications.Anti-emetics should be prescribed only when the cause of vomiting is known as they may delay diagnosis. CAUSESDisorders of the gastro-intestinal tract (GIT) and liver: intestinal obstruction, peptic ulcer, pancreatitis, cholecystitis, gastroenteritis, hepatitisNeurological disorders: severe pain, migraine, raised intracranial pressure (i.e. tumours, haemorrhage; meningitis); seizures, strokeEndocrine and metabolic: diabetic ketoacidosis, uraemia, hypercalcaemia, intestinal pseudo-obstructionPsychiatric: anxiety, depression, severe emotional upset, psychogenic vomitingDrugs: cancer chemotherapy, aspirin, allopurinol, digoxin, erythromycin, anticonvulsants, opioidsInfections: malaria, urinary tract infectionsCardiovascular: acute myocardial infarctionRenal: uraemia from acute or chronic kidney diseaseMiscellaneous: pregnancy, cyclical vomiting syndrome, myocardial infarction, labyrinthitis, otitis media SYMPTOMSVomiting may be associated with:Abdominal painDiarrhoea: gastroenteritisAbdominal distension: suspected bowel obstructionHeartburn: suspected gastro-oesophageal reflux diseaseChest painJaundice: hepato-biliary diseaseVertigo and nystagmus: suspected vestibular neuronitisAnxietyDepression Vomiting may have diagnostic clues e.g.:Vomiting of food eaten several hours earlier: gastroparesis or gastric- outlet obstructionVomiting with blood: oesophageal, gastric or duodenal lesionEarly morning vomiting: pregnancyFaeculent vomiting: intestinal obstruction, gastro-colic fistulaProjectile: if pyloric stenosis SIGNSAbdominal tendernessDehydration (reduced skin turgor, dry tongue, hypotension, tachycardia)Abdominal distensionSuccussion splashJaundiceSigns of peritonitis (rebound tenderness, rigidity, guarding)Miscellaneous: e.g. vertigo, nystagmus, focal neurological signs, Kussmaul breathing (uraemia, diabetic ketoacidosis) INVESTIGATIONSFBCBUE and CreatinineLFTBlood glucoseSerum amylaseUrine REUrine Pregnancy testECG (if myocardial infarction suspected)Abdominal X-ray: Intestinal obstructionErect Chest X-ray: bowel perforation with air under diaphragm Persistent Vomiting:Upper gastro-intestinal endoscopySerum calcium levelCT scan of brain TREATMENT Treatment objectivesTo identify and treat the underlying causeTo prevent dehydration and electrolyte imbalanceTo maintain nutrition by ensuring adequate dietary intake during illnessTo maintain personal hygieneTo eliminate infecting organisms where appropriateNon-pharmacological treatmentMaintain adequate oral fluid intake (if tolerated)Maintain adequate nutritionPlace naso-gastric tube when neededSurgical intervention in suspected intestinal obstruction, peritonitisPharmacological treatmentSuggested Anti-Emetics for use in MigraineEvidence Rating: [B]•  Metoclopramide, oral/IV/IM,Adults  10 mg 8 hourlyOr•  Domperidone, oral,Adults  10 mg, 8 hourlyChildren>12 years (Body weight 2" 35 kg); 10 mg 8-12 hourly (max. 30 mg per day)1 month-12 years (Body weight <35 kg); 250 micrograms/kg 8-12 hourly (max. 750 microgram/kg per day)OrNote 2-7Domperidone should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration.

Wilms tumour (nephroblastoma) is a malignant embryonal tumour of renal tissue. It  is the  fourth  commonest cancer  amongst  children in Ghana. About 80% of children with Wilms tumour present before 5 years of age. It can present soon after delivery. It may be associated with congenital anomalies such as hemihypertrophy and the absence of the iris (aniridia). Wilms tumour has a very good prognosis with an over 80% chance of long-term cure.CAUSESSporadic gene mutationSYMPTOMSVisible and or palpable abdominal massFeverBlood in urineSIGNSAbdominal mass (palpate with care to prevent rupture or dissemination)Haematuria (macroscopic or microscopic)HypertensionAssociated congenital anomaliesINVESTIGATIONSAbdominal ultrasound scanAbdominal CT scanChest X-rayFull Blood CountBlood Urea, electrolytes and creatinineTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo obtain long term cureTo provide adequate supportive and palliative careNon-pharmacological treatmentNephrectomyRadiotherapy post-surgery for advanced casesPharmacological treatmentA.

A wound is a break in the continuity of tissues in the body. It may involve overlying epithelium like skin. Wounds are usually caused by injury. Tissues affected include subcutaneous tissue, muscles and even bones. It may be small or large and may be deep or superficial. It may bleed, may be contaminated with dirt and other foreign matter and become infected.CAUSES• Mechanical agents e.g. cut from cutlass or knife, gunshot, accidents, contusion from blunt injury. Wounds may follow snake or insect bites, animal or human bites• Chemical agents e.g. strong acids or alkalis, other corrosive chemicals• Thermal injury resulting in burnsSYMPTOMSLocal painBleedingDischarge of pus if infectedSIGNSLocal swelling and tendernessLook for other injuries e.g., head, chest, abdomen, bone, nervesDetermine the physical characteristics of the wound e.g. site, size, shape and depthINVESTIGATIONSHaemoglobin level if patient has bledGroup and cross-match blood if indicatedX-ray of injured part may be required to rule out osteomyelitis and bone fracturesWound swab for culture and sensitivity if wound is infectedTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo control bleedingTo relieve painTo prevent or treat infectionTo protect against tetanusTo promote wound healingNon-pharmacological treatmentApply sterile pressure dressing to bleeding site and raise the injured part to control bleeding.If a bleeding vessel can be identified, it should be ligated. (the use of tourniquet to stop bleeding is discouraged)Bleeding from a tooth socket - put a small piece of sterile gauze in the socket and ask the patient to bite on it.Box 23-1: Wound ManagementImmediate closure of wounds is good, but this is not advisable if the wound is dirty or likely to become infected e.g. gunshot wounds, animal and human bites and wounds over 6 hours old. They should not be sewn up.Wash hands well and wear sterile gloves. Clean the wound with antiseptic solution. Scrub dirty wounds with antiseptic solution and irrigate with dilute hydrogen peroxide and saline.If there are bits of gravel, glass or dirt in the wound, remove them gently. Lift up all flaps of skin, clean under them, excise all dead tissue and cover the wound with sterile gauze.Anaesthesia may be required.Do not use Eusol, which is both irritant and exposes patient to unnecessary borate levels Dress infected wound as often as needed with normal saline or povidone iodine lotion. Take wound swab for culture and sensitivity test if possible and start Amoxicillin while waiting for results of wound culture.

This condition is common in children. It is associated with inadequate intake of foods that contain Vitamin A. It is a common cause of blindness in children. It is important to prevent this condition by examining the eyes of all sick and malnourished children. The diet of children should include foods that contain Vitamin A (dark green leafy vegetables e.g. nkontomire, yellow fruits and vegetables, palm oil, milk, eggs).Parents and other caregivers should be discouraged from putting any traditional preparations such as herbs, sea water, saliva, urine, etc. or drugs into the eye unless prescribed by a physician.CAUSESVitamin A deficiency resulting fromProtein calorie malnutritionMeaslesMalabsorption statesSYMPTOMSPoor night vision (in the early stages)SIGNSDry conjunctivaGrey scleraConjunctival folding (wrinkling)Keratomalacia (cloudy cornea, soft and easy ulceration)INVESTIGATIONSNilTREATMENTTreatment objectivesTo recognize and correct vitamin A deficiencyTo prevent complications e.g. blindnessNon-pharmacological treatmentHigh vitamin A containing foods should be encouragedPharmacological treatmentGive Vitamin A to children as soon as the illness is diagnosed and also in patients with measles and malnutritionEvidence Rating: [A]Vitamin A, oral,CHILDRENImmediately after diagnosis1-6 years;  200,000 Units6-11 months;  100,000 UnitsThen (after 24 hours)1-6 years;  200,000 Units6-11 months;  100,000 UnitsThen (after 1 week)1 - 6 years;  200,000 Units6-11 months;  100,000 UnitsREFERRAL CRITERIARefer all established cases of xerophthalmia to an eye specialist if the condition is severe with an uneven or bulging cornea.





    
    
    

YAWSYaws is a chronic infection by a bacterium that affects mainly the skin, bone and cartilage. Most people affected are children under 15 years of age but adults are not exempt. It is transmitted mainly through skin contact with an infected person. A single skin lesion develops at the point of entry of the bacterium after 24 weeks. Without treatment, multiple lesions appear all over the body. The disease is rarely fatal, however it can lead to chronic disfigurement and disability in about 10% of affected individuals if left untreated. Treatment with antibiotics is curative and relapse is rare. Overcrowding, poor personal hygiene and poor sanitation facilitate the spread of the disease.

Yellow FeverYellow fever is caused by a virus transmitted to man by a species of mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti) from infected monkeys. The disease is not spread from person to person. Classical yellow fever is usually fatal.After the onset of symptoms, there is a brief remission of 2-24 hours, following which the symptoms may recur with the development of epigastric pain, jaundice, renal insufficiency, cardiovascular instability and bleeding from various sites (e.g. gums and needle-puncture sites).Yellow fever vaccination is protective against the disease and needs to be repeated every ten years. Yellow fever vaccination is a requirement for travel from Ghana to several countries. Note 5-4All cases of yellow fever should be reported to the District Disease Control Officer. CAUSES • Yellow fever virusSYMPTOMS • Fever • Muscle pain, particularly backache • Headache • Shivering • Loss of appetite • Nausea or vomiting • DiarrhoeaSIGNS • Congestion of the conjunctivae • Jaundice • Bleeding from various sites (petechiae, ecchymosis, etc.) • Right upper abdominal quadrant tenderness • Signs of renal failureINVESTIGATIONS • Urinalysis - proteinuria and raised urobilinogen levels • Liver function test • Blood urea, electrolytes and creatinine • Blood sample for yellow fever virus serology (at the Regional Public Health Reference Laboratory)TREATMENTTreatment objectives • To provide supportive care for hepatic, renal and circulatory failure • To manage bleeding disorderNon-pharmacological treatment • If yellow fever is suspected in a patient, admit immediately to an isolation ward • Full supportive treatment for hepatic failure and acute renal failurePharmacological treatmentA.
